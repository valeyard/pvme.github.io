Changing \ud83d\udd03 weapons mid-channel ability Why it\u2019s important: Changing your weapon mid-Conc will cancel it. Thus this requires precise timing to make sure you\u2019re still getting 2 hits from your conc blast. Further, changing your main-hand mid-Conc will lose you the crit bonus from the ability.

Ability Prioritizations & Building \ud83c\udfd7\ud83c\udfd7 a \ud83d\udc36 Rotation Ability Prioritization \u2b25 Generally \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04 speaking, \ud83d\udc4f high \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udd99 damaging abilities should be \u274c prioritized and used \ud83d\ude9f more \u2795\ud83d\udc40 often \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 than low damaging abilities \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, there's a catch. High \ud83c\udd99 damaging abilities often \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 come \ud83d\ude3d with long cooldowns. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f you \ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude20 use \ud83d\ude02 all \ud83d\udc77 of \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udca6 the \ud83d\udd2d\ud83d\ude0d high damaging abilities at \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb0 once, you \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00 will \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc8d be \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udca6 forced to wait for cooldowns before \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc49 you \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude11 may use \ud83d\udd90\ud83d\udd90 them again \ud83d\udd01\ud83e\udd24 \u2013 during which \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f time you are \ud83d\udd22\ud83d\udca9 forced to use low damage \u2604\u2604 abilities. \u2b25 To \ud83d\udd28 circumvent this, the \ud83d\udc4f trick is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude1e to \u270c\ud83d\ude00 use 'filler abilities', abilities with decent damage AND \ud83d\ude4b short cooldowns, in-between your \ud83d\udc75\ud83c\udffc high \u2b06\ud83d\udd1d damaging abilities in order to \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udca6 pace your \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc4f cooldowns. \u2b25 See \ud83d\udc41 this image \ud83d\uddbc\ud83d\udcf8 for \ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf46 an \ud83c\udf46 idea \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd14 of which \ud83d\udc4f abilities should be prioritized based on \u27a1 damage \u2620\u2620 (in \ud83d\udca6 a vacuum): Note: You should not necessarily use abilities in the listed order due to aforementioned reasons. Building a Rotation \u2b25 When building a rotation, ability \ud83d\udc49 prioritizations AND \ud83d\ude47 cooldowns should \ud83d\ude2b be \ud83d\udc1d on \u2b07 your mind. \u2b25 Filler abilities such as Sonic Wave and Concentrated Blast should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Dragon Breath , Corruption Blast , flank Impact , and walked Combust . \u2b25 Any basic ability with damage lower than Sonic Wave/Concentrated Blast / would be considered a weak ability (Wrack , Tuska's Wrath , Sacrifice , non-flank Impact , single-target Chain ). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally \ud83d\ude04 speaking, these \ud83d\udcc0 should \ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc6b be \u26b0 avoided. \u2b25 If you are 2H or DW camping, you will be limited to only one filler ability (Sonic Wave or Concentrated Blast , respectively). Thus, try to utilize Sonic Wave or Concentrated Blast as often as possible in your rotation. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A basic pattern of Sonic Wave \u2192 Ability \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat is recommended for camping rotations. \u2b25 For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Sonic Wave and Concentrated Blast as filler abilities. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This \u2753 lets \ud83d\ude9f\u26d4 you have \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc35 more breathing \ud83d\udc33\ud83d\udc33 room \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude36 in \ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udffb what \ud83d\udca3 rotations and fillers you \ud83d\udc81\ud83d\udcaa create. \ud83d\udcf2 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 While there is no singular rotation that is best here, a general pattern of Sonic Wave \u2192 Ability \u2192 Concentrated Blast \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat will give you strong dps.

\u2b25 It is \u2049 important to properly \u2611 cancel \u274c abilities in \ud83d\udc4f order \u274c to \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca6 not \ud83d\udeab lose \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 any ticks, as

\ud83c\udf93 apply \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Watch the following example of a Cancelled vs an Uncancelled channel (Snipe in this scenario) When to Cancel Channels \u2b25 In almost all scenarios, you will cancel Concentrated Blast on its 2nd hit, this is as your Global Cooldown ends (3t/1.8s) \u2b25 Typically you will cancel your Asphyxiate on the 4th hit (7t/4.2s) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To cancel on 3rd \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 hit \ud83d\udca5 you \ud83d\udc4b would cancel on t5 (3s) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To \ud83d\ude02 cancel \u274c\u274c on

Smoke Tendrils \u2b25 For \ud83d\ude0f\ud83c\udf46 more \ud83d\ude24\ud83c\udf65 information \ud83d\udcc4 on \ud83d\udcf2 cancelling, refer to #Evil \ud83c\udf12\ud83d\udc79 Lucario's \ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc36 Video \ud83d\ude45 on \ud83d\udd1b cancelling Note: The Buff Bar timers are outdated in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unCtj7IosVA \ud83e\udd11\ud83d\ude0e Detonate What Makes Detonate Unique \u2b25 As mentioned, Magic has 4 channels, 3 of which were mentioned prior, this section will be dedicated to Detonate due to how differently it works compared to other channels \u2b25 Unlike most channels Detonate acts like or can have the following done within it: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It acts somehwat like a defensive in the context of defensive autos (you can release Detonate with an Auto given the Auto is not on cooldown) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can throw Vulnerability Bombs during its charge time \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can SBS during its charge time \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You \ud83e\udd14 can Shield \ud83d\udca6\u2697 Dome during its charge time \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udc67 can \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udcb0 stall its \ud83d\udc64 release \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Generally \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude04 speaking you cannot \ud83d\udeab stall channels (outside of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb0 melees wherein only \ud83d\udd66 1 \ud83d\udc9e hit is \ud83d\udc4c stalled) \u2b25 Typically, when releasing Detonate you will release it with an Auto and an Ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 An example would be the following: Auto Sonic Wave \u2192 Detonate (3t/1.8s) \u2192 Auto Deto Dragon Breath ( \u2192 (3t/1.8s) \u2192 ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The order things are listed here are important, you want to do Auto then Detonate then Dragon Breath on the same tick in that order to release them with Detonate \u2b25 There is an odd occurence wherein Detonate will cost 30% adrenaline instead of 15% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This \ud83d\udc49 can \ud83d\udc46 be explained as \ud83d\udcb0 follows: \u2640\u2640 the \ud83d\udea7\ud83c\udf69 game \ud83d\udda5 thinks \ud83d\udcad\ud83d\udcad you \u2620\ud83d\udca6 both \ud83c\udfff\ud83c\udf1c have a \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\ude0e target and not at \u2642\ud83d\ude93 the \ud83d\udd75\ud83c\udf81 same time, \ud83d\ude31 so \ud83d\udd65\ud83c\udf03 it uses \ud83c\udd92\ud83c\udd92 adrenaline \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 from both your target and \ud83d\udc4f the \ud83d\udc4f adrenaline inherently used from using \ud83d\udce4 it \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udca6 without \ud83d\ude0f a \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- To prevent this, try casting any damaging ability before you hit Detonate \u2b25 Further, Detonate works like normal AoEs wherein it is centered at the true center of the target (for any >=2x2 target this will be the SW tile) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, \ud83d\udd90\ud83d\udd90 if \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udcb5 you \ud83d\ude2b cast Detonate without \ud83d\udeab\u274c a \ud83d\ude24 target, it will \ud83c\udfa4 be centered \u26c4 on \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udd1b your player \u2b25 Moreover, its \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\ude45 worth keeping in mind \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcad the \ud83d\udc4f difference \u2757 in AoE size \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\ude16 dependent on the charge of deto on release, as represented in the \ud83d\ude9f following diagram: Dual \ud83d\udd2b\ud83c\udfcf Wield vs Staff Camp This \ud83c\udffc section \ud83d\udce6 is \ud83d\udca6 meant \ud83d\udeab to \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude14 list the \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\ude3c benefits of camping one \u261d\ud83c\udf73 over \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude11 the other \ud83d\udc6a\ud83c\udfb4 though it \ud83c\udf5d is strongly recommended to \u270c\ud83d\ude0b just juggle, as \ud83c\udf51 it \ud83d\udeb6\ud83d\ude20 gives access \ud83d\udd16 to \ud83d\udcb0 all \u2b50\ud83c\udf46 the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf51 following benefits, and \ud83c\udff3\u2640 more. Staff Camp Benefits \u2b25 Access to 2H Autos \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 When staff camping this lets you make use of Defensive Autos to replace weaker abilities like Tuska's Wrath which you would otherwise have to use due to lack of abilities \u2b25 More \ud83d\ude09 Revolution-friendly \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Due to using Sonic Wave over Concentrated Blast , as Sonic Wave is not a channeled ability. Dual Wield Camp Benefits \u2b25 Easier swapping \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can swap to Shield or Flanks more easily, as you do not need to do an additional mainhand swap Defensive Autos Note: While this section is colloquialy referred to as \"Defensive Autos\", it is more technical to say it is non-damaging abilities, and so includes Sunshine and Metamorphosis . Why Defensive Autos Exist \u2b25 Typically, when you cast an ability it put your Auto on cooldown based on the weapon speed of the weapon it was cast with \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 i.e., if you \ud83d\ude00 cast an \ud83d\udc79 average \ud83d\udcc8 speed (staff ability) \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 it \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd37 will \ud83d\udcb0 be 6t (3.6s), if \ud83d\udd1f\ud83c\udfc3 you \ud83d\udc4f cast a fastest speed \u23e9\u23e9 (wand \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf46 ability) \ud83d\udc49 it \ud83d\udcaf\u203c will \u26bd\ud83d\udca6 be 4t (2.4s) \u2b25 Non-damaging \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6 abilities are \ud83d\udd22\ud83d\udcb0 the \u2642 exception to \ud83d\udca6 this \ud83d\udcaf rule, \u2696\u2696 so \ud83d\udcaf if you cast one it will \ud83d\udc6e\ud83d\udc6b not \ud83d\udeab put \ud83d\ude0f your auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 on cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This has \u274c several implications, the \ud83c\udf0d first applies to \ud83d\udd03\ud83c\udf0b all \ud83d\udcaf styles, the \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcb0 second \ud83e\udd48 is \ud83d\udc02 magic \u2728 specific Implications \u2b25 Firstly, this means if you cast a dual wield ability into a defensive ability, your Auto will happen mid Global Cooldown (GCD) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Normally this will be whatever you have set as your autocasted spell, however you can alter what will be cast with the defensive by doing the spell (e.g., Ice Barrage or Entagle ) then the defensive \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The \u23e9 following table will \ud83d\ude4f break \ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude25 down \u2b07\u2b07 the ticks of \u2642\ud83d\udc78 this: T0: Wand Ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 T3: Defensive T4: Auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 is \ud83e\udd14 cast T6: Ability \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H Auto , as the cooldown for any Auto ends on t4, so you would simply swap to a 2H weapon somewhere between the dw abil cast and the defensive cast, or right after the defensive cast and before the Auto would be cast (this then puts your 2H auto on a 6t (3.6s) cd where you wont be able to cast it at all) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A \ud83d\ude3e further \ud83d\ude1d consideration, is \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udf46 if \ud83e\udd37 that \ud83c\udffb\u270c ability \ud83d\udc49 on \ud83d\udd1b\u23ef t6 is \ud83e\udd14 a \ud83d\udcaf non-channeled \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6 dw ability, you \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc48 can \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udcaf 4tick an \ud83d\udc89 ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 afterwards \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This \ud83c\udf81\ud83d\udc48 can \u2753 be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d seen in the \ud83d\ude40 following video \ud83d\udcf9 by \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udfa8 #Glaucon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmsbPrkqrtw \u2b25 Secondly, a \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udc4c benefit magic \u2728 has, \ud83d\udc4f due \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 to \ud83d\ude31 it having auto \ud83e\udd16 binds, is that \ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\ude0f you \ud83d\ude0d\u2640 can \ud83d\udee2\ud83d\udca6 make sure \ud83e\udd14 an \ud83d\udc79\ud83c\udfff auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 + ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 cast on the \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude31 same tick (rather than an \ud83d\udcb6\ud83d\udc45 auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 is \ud83d\udca6 cast on 1 tick, and \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udca6 the \ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf0e ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 a \ud83c\udd70 tick after) \ud83c\udffb \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This \ud83d\udc4b allows magic \ud83d\udcff\ud83d\udcff to \u2642\ud83d\udc49 do \ud83d\ude24 a \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc4c 2H abil into \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83d\udc4c defensive auto \ud83e\udd16 as a result \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following table \ud83d\ude3e\ud83c\udfd3 will break \ud83d\udc94 down \ud83d\udca6 the \ud83d\udcaf ticks of this: T0: Staff Ability \ud83d\udc49 T3: Defensive T6: Auto + Ability \ud83d\udc49 \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude0f Melee and Ranged this \u261d\ud83d\ude00 would \ud83d\ude0e\ud83c\udd71 result in: T0: Average \ud83d\udcb0 Speed \u23e9\u23e9 2H Ability \ud83d\udc49 T3: Defensive T6: Auto T7: Ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude00 is \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udca6 important \u274c\ud83e\udd23 as \ud83c\udf51 it \ud83d\udcaf is \ud83d\ude9f highly beneficial to \ud83e\udd11 make \ud83d\udce3 use \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4f of this when \ud83c\udf51 staff camping, as it will aid in preventing you \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude0f using \ud83e\udd33\ud83d\udce4 bad \ud83d\udd25 abilities like \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d Tuska's Wrath and \ud83d\udca6 Sacrifice due \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 to \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udca6 the \ud83d\udc40 lack of \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udddc abilities at \ud83d\ude20\ud83c\udffe your \ud83c\udf46 disposal \u2b25 It is important to note that Freedom works a little differently, in that you will get both an off-hand and a main-hand/2h auto \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by casting the auto before, but on the same tick, as Freedom \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff you wanted to change \ud83c\udf21\ud83d\udd00 what the 2H auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 is, you \ud83d\ude45 would \ud83d\ude02 have to 3 tick it \ud83d\udc93 . \u2b25 It \ud83d\ude3c is \u274c\ud83d\udd25 also \u2795\u2795 important \u2705\u274c to \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udca6 note that \u27a1\ud83c\udffe if \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4f you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude35 click anything from your \u26cf\ud83d\udc4f inventory, or \ud83d\udcb0 click the \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udcf2 ground \ud83d\udd1d anywhere, before \ud83d\ude29 the \ud83d\udea7\ud83d\udcaa auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 would naturally fire then \ud83d\udc4f you \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc76 must re-click your \ud83c\udf46 target \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With Magic, \u2728\u2728 hitting \ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26 your \ud83d\udc49 auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 bind yields the same result Delaying Defensive Auto \u2b25 Based \ud83d\udcaf off \ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd14 this fact, \ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udd0d you \ud83d\ude29 can make \u2640 use \u270a\ud83d\udc4f of \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\ude8b this if \u261d you \ud83e\udd14\u274c need \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude02 to \ud83d\udca6 delay a \u27a1\ud83d\udcaf defensive auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 for \ud83c\udf85 whatever \ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc46 reason \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude24 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 More specifically, this can be useful for Freedom if you need to change what both the off-hand and 2H auto are when casting Freedom after a faster than Average speed weapon, as you can only change the 2H Auto if you 3t it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following examples will be done with Freedom , however the same idea applies to delaying the auto with other non-damaging abilities, except that you only have the 2H Auto and that you can off any time after your ability before the defensive and by the time the Auto should be cast \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For Freedom specifically, we will \"off\" to delay the auto directly after the OH Auto is cast, otherwise we lose the OH Auto \u2b25 There are \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude4f several ways \u2714 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 \"off\" \ud83c\udd71 to delay the auto, \ud83e\udd16 these \ud83d\ude31\u274c include: \ud83d\ude20 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking under \ud83d\udc47 yourself \ud83d\udc48 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking a spell \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd24 you cannot \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc40 cast (e.g., trying \ud83d\ude3c\ud83d\ude3c to \ud83d\ude20\u27a1 cast Disruption Shield when \u23f0 on \ud83c\udffd the \ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udf42 Ancient \ud83c\udfb6 Spellbook) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking something \ud83d\ude33 from \ud83d\ude02 your \u2b07 inventory Note: If you do any of these things before or directly as you cast your defensive normally you will either have to click or hit your auto bind again to actually cast your auto. \u2b25 There are \ud83d\ude02 also a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udd70 couple differences between \ud83d\udc4f hitting your auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 bind \ud83d\udc54 to \ud83d\ude02 cast your \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udf51 auto and \u270b\ud83d\udd23 clicking to \ud83d\ude16 cast your \ud83d\ude0d auto \ud83e\udd16 after you \ud83d\udc49 \"off\", \ud83d\udcf4 they \ud83c\udffd are as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You \ud83d\ude40 cannot hit your auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 bind \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c to try and \u2795\ud83c\udf46 recast your \ud83c\udffb auto \ud83e\udd16 mid-GCD, you \ud83e\udd13\u270b need \ud83c\udf46 to 3 tick it \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude02 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udc4f you \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude18 use \ud83d\udc4f your \ud83d\ude34 auto bind \ud83d\udc54 to recast your auto, \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 you \ud83c\udfc3 can \ud83d\udd2b alter what \u23f1\ud83d\ude1f the \ud83c\udfff\ud83c\udf43 auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 will be when you \ud83d\udc4f cast it \ud83c\udf5d\ud83d\udc71 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You \ud83c\udfc3 can \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc91 click \ud83d\uddb1\ud83d\uddb1 to \ud83d\ude2f recast your auto \ud83e\udd16 mid-GCD \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If \ud83c\udffe you \ud83d\udc46 click \ud83d\uddb1 to \ud83d\udde3 recast your auto, \ud83e\udd16 your \ud83c\udfc0\ud83d\ude29 next \ud83d\udcc6 ability \ud83d\udc49 must \ud83d\ude4b\ud83d\udcaf be at \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude29 least \ud83d\udc4f 1 \u2b07 tick after \ud83d\udc40 otherwise you \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udca6 will \ud83d\udc8d override it \ud83d\ude2d \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- if \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude02 you click \ud83d\uddb1 to recast your auto \ud83e\udd16 ideally you do it mid-GCD so \u2139\u2753 that \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 you do not \ud83e\udd27\ud83c\udd70 waste \u2639 ticks \u2b25 Thus, for Freedom we can do as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Instead \ud83e\udd37\u2642 of the normal T0: Dual \ud83c\udfcf Wield Ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 T3: Freedom + OH \ud83d\ude2e Auto \ud83e\udd16 Cast T4: 2H Auto cast T6:

I manually change the Defensive Auto to Fire Surge where possible for sake of demonstration \u2b25 What are \ud83d\ude31 the differences between these two \ud83d\udc8f\ud83d\udc24 scenarios? \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The 2H Auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 is cast and thus hits at \ud83d\udca6 different \ud83c\udffc times \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We \ud83c\udfc3 can alter the \ud83c\udf1f\u26d3 2H Auto in \ud83d\udc48 the \ud83d\udcb0 second scenario, whereas in \ud83d\udc4f the \ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf69 first \ud83d\ude22 it \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude40 will be \ud83c\udfae\ud83e\udd14 whatever \ud83d\udc46\u2640 your \ud83d\udc49 autocasted spell is \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude40 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- We can alter the OH Auto in both scenarios by simply doing Other Auto \u2192 Freedom (e.g., \u2192 ) Note: This is how we can alter the Auto sent with Non-Damaging Abilities normally as well, though you can still alter it if you \"off\" for it and 3 tick it afterwards like the 2H Auto with Freedom . Switches This \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc section will \u2640 detail several \ud83c\udfcb\u2642 switches that are \u263a useful for \ud83d\udc98 magic, \ud83d\udcff\ud83d\udcff and \ud83d\udc4f should \ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc98 be \u2714 incorporated as \ud83c\udf51 comfortable and when \ud83c\udf51 relevant. Juggling / \u2b25 This \ud83c\udf85\ud83d\udcf2 is \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udca6 simply referring to either adding a \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c Dual \ud83d\udd2b Wield swap or \ud83d\udc81 Staff swap depending on \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\udd1b if \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc40 you \ud83d\udc67\ud83c\udfff currently \u231a Staff camp or Dual Wield Camp. \u2b25 This is highly beneficial to do as it gives you access to Conc Blast or Sonic Wave respectively. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thus, \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4c it \ud83d\ude02\u2753 gives \ud83d\ude1a you \ud83d\udd25 a \ud83d\udc4c new \ud83c\udd95 filler ability to make \ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udffb use of \ud83d\ude15 and \u270a so \ud83d\udc4f you \u261d\ud83c\udffb can manage cooldowns more \ud83d\ude40 effective and also increase \ud83d\udcb3\ud83d\udcb3 your average damage \u2604 overall. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Moreover, it gives \ud83d\ude1a\ud83d\ude1a you all \ud83e\udd20\ud83d\udcaf the benefits that \ud83c\udf5c Staff camping and Dual \ud83c\udfcf Wield camping alone \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43 provides. \u2b25 This is a \ud83c\udfff good \ud83c\udf5d\ud83d\udc4c stepping stone \ud83d\udeac for \ud83c\udf85 those that wish \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude22 to \ud83d\udca6 move \ud83d\udd1b away \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udca8 from \ud83d\udc49 weapon \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udeae camping but are \ud83d\udc13 not confident enough, \ud83d\udc45 or \ud83e\udd56\ud83d\udcb0 simply \ud83d\ude21\u2935 to \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udca3 not \ud83e\udd1c\u274c desire, to 4-tick \ud83d\ude47 auto \ud83e\udd16 attack \ud83e\udd3c\ud83e\udd3c (4TAA). Guthix Staff \u2b25 This is a \ud83d\udc79 basic \ud83d\ude82 switch to incorporate into rotations, and is \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 beneficial to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 do \ud83d\udc4c so \ud83d\ude9c where \ud83d\ude08\ud83e\udd37 possible. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udcba is \ud83c\udf4e generally \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04 speaking \ud83d\udc4f bosses where \ud83e\udd37 you \ud83c\udffe require \ud83d\udcdc the \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude91 affinity debuff or \ud83c\udffc if \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4f you \ud83d\udc76 have excess adrenaline \ud83d\udc89 to \u26d4\ud83d\udd22 dump. \u2b25 The \ud83c\udf52\ud83d\udcaf main purpose \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc80 of \ud83d\udd1f\ud83d\ude23 incorporating this switch is \ud83d\ude29 to make use \u274c of \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\udd0c its special \u2604\u2708 attack. \u2694 \u2b25 There are a \ud83d\udc1d\ud83c\udd71 few \ud83d\ude0b considerations to \ud83d\udca6 list, \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udcc7 and \ud83d\udd3d\ud83c\udf0d they \ud83d\udc65\ud83d\udc86 are \ud83d\udc76\ud83d\udc74 as follows: \ud83c\udfc3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is benficial to Ring of Vigour this special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This brings \ud83d\udd19 the adrenline cost \ud83d\udcb2\ud83d\udcb0 from \ud83d\udde3 25% to \ud83e\udd14\u23f1 22.5%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If you have Aftershock you will have to 0-tick your special attack in order to keep your Aftershock stacks. \u2b25 0-ticking in this context refers to swapping from a weapon with Aftershock to Guthix Staff , which does not have it, to a different weapon with Aftershock in the same tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This works \ud83d\ude92 because \u274c\ud83d\udcdd the game \ud83c\udfae only \ud83d\udc6c\ud83d\ude0e checks \u2714 if \u2614\ud83c\udfff Aftershock is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udd2e on at \ud83d\udcb0 the end \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf of \ud83d\udc6f a tick. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Starting on Weapon A, to do this simply do: \u2192 \u2192 Weapon B \u2b25 If \ud83d\udc49 you 4TAA, you \ud83c\udffb will \ud83d\udca3 generally \ud83d\udc40 wish \ud83c\udf20\ud83c\udf20 to \ud83d\udca6 Auto \ud83e\udd16 into \ud83d\udc4f this \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude0b special \ud83d\udc4b attack (as \ud83c\udfff it \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc8b is \ud83d\udcc5\ud83d\udc4d an \ud83e\udd3c Average \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udcc8 Speed weapon, \u2694\ud83d\udeae so \ud83d\uddff\ud83d\udcaf think of \ud83c\udf52 it \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb8 as \ud83d\udc66 a Staff Ability). \ud83d\udc49 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thus, to 0-tick your spec starting on Weapon A you will have to: \u2192 \u2192 equip Weapon B \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If \ud83d\udc4f you \ud83d\ude18\u2795 do \ud83d\udc4c not \u274c\ud83d\ude45 wish \u23ee to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc89 0-tick \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\ude0f your \ud83d\udcaf spec, then \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\udca5 you \ud83d\udc46 do not \u274c\u2716 need \ud83d\udc4d to do \ud83d\udc4c the \ud83d\udca1 weapon \ud83d\udde1 swap at \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0e the \ud83d\udd25 end \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude23 on the \ud83d\udd1d\ud83e\udd83 same tick. Planted Feet \u2b25 This \ud83d\ude15 is \ud83e\udd14 a very \ud83c\udffd strong switch \ud83c\udf9a\ud83c\udf9a that \ud83d\udeac\ud83d\ude27 requires minimal effort to \ud83d\ude0b incorporate. \u2b25 This perk increases the duration of Sunshine at the cost of its Damage over Time (DoT). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It makes Sunshine's duration go from 52t/31.2s total (t0\u219251) to 64t/38.4s total (t0\u2192t63). \u2b25 Generally speaking you always want to Sunshine with your Planted Feet switch. \u2b25 Typically this \ud83d\udc41\ud83d\ude0d perk \u23eb\u23eb will \ud83c\udffb go \ud83c\udfc3 on a defender so \ud83d\udcaf that \ud83d\ude9f\ud83d\udcb0 you do \u26a0 not need \u2705\ud83d\udc4d to \ud83d\udca6 bring \ud83d\udcc9\u2b05 both a \u23f0\ud83d\ude18 shield \ud83d\udca6 and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udcb0 planted feet \ud83d\udc63 when \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\ude29 a shield is required for \u270b\ud83c\udf85 Resonance or building \ud83c\udfd7 adrenaline \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 only \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc4f \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This perk \u23eb\u23eb can \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b also be \ud83d\udc1d seen \ud83d\udc40 put on \ud83d\udd1b Wands \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further, in \ud83d\udc4f rare instances, this perk \u23eb\u23eb can also be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d seen \ud83d\udc40 put on \ud83d\ude9f an \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude05 Enhanced Excalibur for \ud83c\udf84 content that \ud83d\udcb2 requires both \ud83d\udc66 a shield \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 and \ud83d\ude99\ud83e\udd20 planted feet \ud83d\udc63\ud83d\udc63 switch \ud83c\udf9a\ud83c\udf9a where \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\ude3e saving \ud83c\udf31 any inventory space \ud83d\ude2b is \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\ude29 important. \ud83d\ude0d Flanking \u2b25 This is a \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udcb0 simple, \u26aa\u26aa yet strongly \ud83d\udcaa recommend switch \ud83d\udc91\ud83d\udc91 to \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udca9 incorporate, especially \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude08 for \ud83d\udea6 those doing group-based content. \u2b25 This turns Impact and Deep Impact into far stronger abilities at the cost of their stun which is largely irrelevant \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It increases Minimum of Impact by (Flanking Rank * 8)% and its Max by (Flanking Rank * 40)% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It increases Minimum of Deep Impact by (Flanking Rank * 6)% and its Max by (Flanking Rank * 30)% \u2b25 It is \ud83c\udf83\ud83d\ude33 recommended to put \ud83c\udf85 this \ud83c\udf81 perk \u23eb on \ud83d\ude33 an off-hand \ud83d\udca6 switch \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Reduces the damage and accuracy loss of using a lower tier weapon for switch (Praesul Wand + Virtus Book > + Imperium Core ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Due \ud83d\udc45 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc49 the \ud83d\udc40 fact \ud83d\udcd3 that if \ud83e\udd14 you swap main-hands you \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude18 lose \ud83d\udeab the crit buff \ud83d\udcaa of \ud83d\udca6 Concentrated Blast \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5 Dragonrider Amulet \u2b25 This \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udd75 is \u2764 a more \u2795\u270c advanced switch \ud83c\udf9a\ud83d\udc91 thats \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\ude9f usefulness goes \ud83d\ude29 down \u2b07\u2b07 as the necklace \ud83d\udc8d you \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udffb primarily wear \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f gets \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude35 better. \ud83d\udca6 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Unless Reaper Necklace accuracy is needed, in the current state of the game even with an Essence of Finality (or) equipped it is still a DPS increase to incorporate this as a switch. \u2b25 This necklace increases the power of Dragon Breath \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It boosts its \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udd97 damage \u2604\u2604 by \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc7c 10% \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udd7e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It has a 10% chance of applying a bleeding effect that hits 3 times and deals 10% of Dragon Breath's max hit rounded down per hit \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This \ud83d\ude15 excludes boosts that do \ud83d\udca6\u2642 not normally boost bleeds Seren Godbow \u2b25 This \ud83d\ude37\ud83c\udffb is \ud83e\udd14 an advanced \u269b switch \ud83d\udc91 to incorporate into \ud83d\ude9f\ud83c\udf50 rotations, though \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udca5 it is highly beneficial to do \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udcac so \ud83d\ude18\ud83c\udf39 where it is \ud83c\udfa4 worth \ud83c\udf10 it. \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude20 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 this is \ud83d\ude2f\ud83d\udc76 generally \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 speaking \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24 bosses that \u261d are \u2640 5x5 in size or \ud83d\udcaf larger. \u2b25 The \ud83d\ude06 main purpose \ud83d\ude35 of \ud83d\udca6 incorporating this switch \ud83d\udc91\ud83c\udf9a is to make \ud83d\ude24 use \u274c of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcf0 its \ud83d\ude45 special \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcaf attack. \u2694 \u2b25 There \ud83d\udc4c are \ud83d\udd22\ud83d\udca2 a few considerations to list, and they \u2049 are as \ud83d\udc66\ud83c\udf51 follows: \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\ude97 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You must own the Ingenuity of the Humans ability (Ingen) to ensure the special attack does not splash. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If \ud83c\udfff you \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude29 do \ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udfff not, \ud83c\udffc depending on \ud83d\udd1b the content \ud83d\ude0a done, \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udfff you \u2049\ud83d\udc76 may \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udd73 have \ud83d\udcaf to \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udca6 remove \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab several \ud83d\udd02\ud83d\udcaf pieces of armor to reduce the \ud83d\udcdc odds of \u261d splashing. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is beneficial to Ring of Vigour this special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc48 brings \ud83d\udd19 the \ud83d\udd70\ud83d\udcb3 adrenaline \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 cost from \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude2e 30% \u2708\ud83d\udcc5 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 27%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is highly beneficial to pray flick to either Anguish or Desolation . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This not only increases accuracy if you need to cast the special attack without Ingen , but also considerably increases the damage in any scenario. \u2b25 If you 4taa, you will generally wish to Auto into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is worth noting as it \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udca6 is \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude26 a heavy input \ud83d\udceb\ud83d\udceb sequence to execute in \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf4c a \ud83d\udc2d\ud83c\udd71 single tick: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The order in which you do things does not necessarily matter so long as the Auto is first and the Special is last. 4TAA What it is \u2b25 4-tick \ud83c\udff3 Auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 Attack \u2694 (4TAA), is \ud83d\udc4f an extension of \ud83d\udc44 weapon \u2694\u2694 juggling wherein, as \ud83c\udf51 the \ud83d\ude9f name \ud83d\udcdb\u2b05 implies, you force \ud83c\udf11 an \ud83d\udc4f auto attack \u2694 on \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd24 the \ud83c\udffd 4th tick after \ud83d\udc40\u23f3 casting the \ud83d\udd1a ability before \ud83d\udd19\ud83d\udd19 \u2b25 As \ud83c\udf51 mentioned earlier, when \ud83d\udca6 you \ud83d\udc49 cast a \ud83c\udfff damaging ability it will \ud83d\udcb0\ud83e\udd24 put \u2642\ud83c\udfff your autos on \ud83d\udd1b\ud83d\udca6 cooldown \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 4t cooldown after a \ud83d\udc4c fastest speed (wand) \ud83d\udca6\u26a1 ability, \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 6t after \ud83d\ude29\ud83c\udf4a an average \ud83d\udcb0 speed (staff) ability \u2b25 So to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udde3 4TAA, we \ud83d\ude31 make \ud83d\udc4f use of this fact, along \ud83d\udc81 with the fact \ud83d\udd0d that Magic can \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\udd2b force an \u2b05\ud83d\udc95 auto + ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 on the \ud83e\udd13\ud83c\udffb same \ud83d\udca9 tick due \ud83d\udc45 to \u23ec having \ud83d\ude38\ud83d\udc49 access \ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\udeaa to \ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd8a spell (and thus auto) \ud83e\udd16 binds \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We make \u2642\ud83d\ude24 use of \ud83d\udca6 this \ud83d\udc48 by \ud83d\ude9f\ud83d\ude08 delaying our \ud83d\udcb0 next ability \ud83d\udc49 by a \ud83d\udcb0 tick to force an auto and ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 on \ud83c\udffd the \ud83d\udc4f 4th tick How it Works \u2b25 The \u2b06\ud83d\udc66 general \ud83d\udc6e 4TAA structure will \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\ude18 be \u26b0 like: Auto \ud83e\udd16 + 2H/Dw Ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 \u2192 non-channeled \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6 Dw Ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 \u2192 Repeat

\ud83d\udc98\ud83d\ude2b your ability will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd24 be \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\udc1d delayed as \ud83c\udf51 your \ud83d\udc44 auto will \ud83d\udc4f automatically \ud83e\udd16\ud83d\ude29

will be dedicated to Detonate due to how differently it works compared to other channels \u2b25 Unlike most channels Detonate acts like or can have the following done within it: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It acts somehwat like a defensive in the context of defensive autos (you can release Detonate with an Auto given the Auto is not on cooldown) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can throw Vulnerability Bombs during its charge time \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can SBS during its charge time \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You \ud83e\udd14 can Shield \ud83d\udca6\u2697

\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Generally \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude04 speaking you cannot \ud83d\udeab stall channels (outside of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb0 melees wherein only \ud83d\udd66 1 \ud83d\udc9e hit is \ud83d\udc4c stalled) \u2b25 Typically, when releasing Detonate you will release it with an Auto and an Ability \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 An example would be the following: Auto Sonic Wave \u2192 Detonate (3t/1.8s) \u2192 Auto Deto Dragon Breath ( \u2192 (3t/1.8s) \u2192 ) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The order things are listed here are important, you want to do Auto then Detonate then Dragon Breath on the same tick in that order to release them with Detonate \u2b25 There is an odd occurence wherein Detonate will cost 30% adrenaline instead of 15% \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This \ud83d\udc49 can \ud83d\udc46 be explained as \ud83d\udcb0 follows: \u2640\u2640 the \ud83d\udea7\ud83c\udf69 game \ud83d\udda5 thinks

so \ud83d\udd65\ud83c\udf03 it uses \ud83c\udd92\ud83c\udd92 adrenaline \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 from both your target and \ud83d\udc4f the \ud83d\udc4f adrenaline inherently used from using

\u200e \u200e\u2022 However, \ud83d\udd90\ud83d\udd90 if \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udcb5 you \ud83d\ude2b cast Detonate without \ud83d\udeab\u274c a \ud83d\ude24 target, it will \ud83c\udfa4 be centered

a dual wield ability into a defensive ability, your Auto will happen mid Global Cooldown (GCD) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Normally this will be whatever you have set as your autocasted spell, however you can alter what will be cast with the defensive by doing the spell (e.g., Ice Barrage or Entagle ) then the defensive \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The \u23e9 following table will

\ud83e\udd14 cast T6: Ability \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Further, you can exploit this to make it a 2H Auto , as the cooldown for any Auto ends on t4, so you would simply swap to a 2H weapon somewhere between the dw abil cast and the defensive cast, or right after the defensive cast and before the Auto would be cast (this then puts your 2H auto on a 6t (3.6s) cd where you wont be able to cast it at all) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A \ud83d\ude3e further \ud83d\ude1d consideration, is \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udf46 if \ud83e\udd37 that \ud83c\udffb\u270c ability \ud83d\udc49 on

\u200e \u200e\u2022 You will always get the off-hand auto, and what is cast as an off-hand auto can be changed by casting the auto before, but on the same tick, as Freedom \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- If \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfff you wanted to change \ud83c\udf21\ud83d\udd00 what the 2H auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 is, you \ud83d\ude45 would \ud83d\ude02 have to 3 tick it \ud83d\udc93 . \u2b25 It \ud83d\ude3c is \u274c\ud83d\udd25 also \u2795\u2795 important \u2705\u274c to \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udca6 note that \u27a1\ud83c\udffe if \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4f you

\u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 More specifically, this can be useful for Freedom if you need to change what both the off-hand and 2H auto are when casting Freedom after a faster than Average speed weapon, as you can only change the 2H Auto if you 3t it \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The following examples will be done with Freedom , however the same idea applies to delaying the auto with other non-damaging abilities, except that you only have the 2H Auto and that you can off any time after your ability before the defensive and by the time the Auto should be cast \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For Freedom specifically, we will \"off\" to delay the auto directly after the OH Auto is cast, otherwise we lose the OH Auto \u2b25 There are \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude4f several ways \u2714 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 \"off\" \ud83c\udd71 to delay the auto, \ud83e\udd16 these \ud83d\ude31\u274c include: \ud83d\ude20 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Clicking under \ud83d\udc47 yourself

\ud83d\ude37\ud83c\udffb is \ud83e\udd14 an advanced \u269b switch \ud83d\udc91 to incorporate into \ud83d\ude9f\ud83c\udf50 rotations, though \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udca5 it is highly beneficial to do \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udcac so \ud83d\ude18\ud83c\udf39 where it is \ud83c\udfa4 worth \ud83c\udf10 it. \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude20 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 this is \ud83d\ude2f\ud83d\udc76

incorporating this switch \ud83d\udc91\ud83c\udf9a is to make \ud83d\ude24 use \u274c of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcf0 its \ud83d\ude45 special \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcaf attack. \u2694 \u2b25 There

beneficial to Ring of Vigour this special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc48 brings \ud83d\udd19 the \ud83d\udd70\ud83d\udcb3 adrenaline \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 cost from \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude2e 30% \u2708\ud83d\udcc5 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 27%. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is highly beneficial to pray flick to either Anguish or Desolation . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This not only increases accuracy if you need to cast the special attack without Ingen , but also considerably increases the damage in any scenario. \u2b25 If you 4taa, you will generally wish to Auto into this special attack (as it is an Average Speed weapon, so think of it as a Staff Ability) \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This is worth noting as it \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udca6 is \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude26 a heavy input \ud83d\udceb\ud83d\udceb sequence to execute in \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf4c a

Choosing a Drygore Ideal Choice \u2b25 It \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude02 is recommended to use a \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udcb0 Drygore Mace and either \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udf3b a \ud83d\udc00\ud83d\ude0e Off-hand

have \u2642 tier \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51 90 ability \ud83d\udc49 damage, \u2604 and if \ud83d\udcb5 only \u2764\ud83d\ude02 using \ud83c\udffb abilities, the \ud83c\udf51\ud83e\udd89 choice of \u2620\u262a Drygores would make no \ud83d\ude23\u274c difference. \u2757 Reasoning \u2b25 If \ud83c\udffe considering auto \ud83e\udd16 attacks, maces have the fastest attack speed, \u23e9 and \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83d\udc4c lower auto \ud83e\udd16 attack damage, \u2620\u2604 whereas longswords and \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc4f rapiers have a slower \ud83d\ude29 attack \ud83e\udd3c\ud83e\udd3c speed

\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udc46 combination of Drygores is \ud83d\udca6 optimal because you \u2642 should \ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc98 never \ud83d\ude45\u203c need \ud83d\ude4f mainhand autos, as \ud83c\udf51 2h autos are \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude4f always preferable, \ud83d\udc4f and the faster \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude80 attack speeds allows for \ud83d\udc4c 5 tick auto attacking. \ud83e\udd3c \u200e \u200e

\u2694\ud83e\udd3c speed \u23e9 is \ud83c\udd71 considered. \ud83e\udd14 Camping a Weapon \ud83c\udff9 What to Pack for Your Camping Trip \u2b25 Camping in this \ud83d\udc48 context \ud83d\ude0e refers to the exclusive usage of \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb0 either DW or \ud83c\udd71 2H without taking advantage of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 the \ud83d\ude03 benefits from \ud83d\udc49 switching. \u2b25 Most players \ud83c\udfae will \ud83d\udc4f start \ud83c\udd95\ud83d\udd79 learning \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17 melee by \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08 grabbing a \ud83d\udca6 2h or DW and \ud83c\udffd camping with said \ud83c\udfff weapon. \u2b25 While you \ud83d\ude0d are limited to \ud83d\udcb0 what \ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26 rotations you can \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\ude42 do while \ud83d\udc71\ud83d\udc71 camping 2h or DW, it \ud83d\udcaf is \ud83d\ude2e still important to \ud83d\udca6 optimize with \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4f what you \ud83d\udca6 have. \ud83c\ude36 \u2b25 Your rotation will be generally built around either Lesser Fury or Greater Fury , depending on availability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 High damage basics such as Cleave (2h exclusive), Decimate (DW exclusive), and Sever should be used as often as possible following Fury. \u2b25 Rotations will follow a simple scheme: Fury \u2192 Ability \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat. \u2b25 The general idea is to build to your Berserk , and then within Berserk, use Assault , then either Destroy (DW) or Hurricane (2h), and then if you have the adrenaline to spare, use either Flurry (DW) or Quake (2h). \u200e

Flanking would be downgraded to a threshold used in-between Berserk cooldowns. \u2b25 This perk should be placed on a Dual Wield Off-hand switch and upgraded to your highest tier available (Drygore t90 or dyed-Khopesh t92). \u2b25 Example bosses to bring flanking to include: Vorago , Angel of Death , group ED1-3 , Solak , and any other group bossing.

I would call this section 'loseless' though that is not technically true. 5TAA \u2b25 Auto \ud83e\udd16 attacks can be used \ud83d\ude9f 'actively' in what's \ud83d\ude05 known \ud83d\udc40 as \ud83e\udd14\ud83c\udf51 5taa. \u2b25 Similar to mage, the idea is \u274c\ud83d\udca6 to \u270c use a 2h auto \ud83e\udd16 attack \ud83e\udd3c\u2694 every \ud83c\udfe6 other \ud83d\udc6a ability, \ud83d\udc49 in \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude19 pattern of: Auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 Attack \u2192 Ability1 \u2192 Ability2 \u2192 Repeat. \ud83d\udd02\ud83d\udd02 https://youtu.be/9cwMPBt6mg0 \u2b25 Ability2 must \ud83d\udd10 be \ud83d\udc1d a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc66 DW ability \ud83d\udc49 and \ud83d\udcaf must \ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude21 not \ud83d\udeab be \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc7b channeled ability. \ud83d\udc49 \u2b25 Input Ability1 as \ud83d\udcb0 soon \ud83d\udcb0 as \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udc91 you \ud83d\udc48 see the sword swing animation \ud83c\udf46 from \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udca6 the \ud83c\udfff Auto attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Timing will take practice. \ud83c\udf46 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 There \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc49 are \u2753\ud83d\ude0e no \u2642\ud83d\ude2d restrictions on what Ability1 can be. \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc68 \u2b25 This \ud83d\udc48 rotation has a similar \ud83d\udc71 damage output compared to \ud83d\ude04 the Deci/Cleave rotation and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f is situationally utilized when \u2642\ud83d\udd5a you run out \ud83c\udfd9 of \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udddc 'good' \ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf5d abilities. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Remember, Auto attacks are \ud83d\udc74 not \u274c\u270b abilities so \ud83d\ude34\ud83c\udd98 they \ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\udc65 are \ud83d\udd22 always \ud83d\udd70 available. \u2714\u2714 https://youtu.be/AzswBOuBnUQ Major Downsides of 5TAA to Consider: \u2b25 Slower \ud83d\ude29 adrenaline \ud83d\udc89 gain: \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa Melee 2h Autos only \ud83d\udc4d\u270b give \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udfff 3% \ud83d\ude2d\u2764 adrenaline. \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Since \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 you are \u2753\ud83d\udca9 doing an \u2b05 auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 every other \ud83d\udcb0 ability, \ud83d\udc49 coupled with \ud83d\udc4c standing \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udd2a idle for \ud83d\udc77 2 ticks every \ud83d\ude30\ud83c\udfe6 other \ud83d\udc6a ability, \ud83d\udc49 you gain \ud83d\udd3c adrenaline \ud83d\udc89 at \u2764 a much slower \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29 pace \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udfff than \ud83d\udd2a with traditional rotations. \u2b25 There \ud83d\udc4c is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 no \u274c\u2642 button \ud83d\udca6 to \ud83d\udca6 force melee auto \ud83e\udd16 attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This means you \ud83d\udc49 have \ud83d\ude4b to \ud83d\udc48\ud83e\udd38 stand \ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udeb6 idle for 2 \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udd25 ticks after \ud83d\udc40 Ability2 and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f wait \ud83c\udd70 for \ud83d\udcb0 the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude4a auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 attack \ud83e\udd3c to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc4c come \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 out, \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\udc4b before inputting your \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udd71 next \ud83c\udf28\ud83d\udc49 ability. \ud83d\udc49 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Proper timing will \ud83c\udf46 require practice. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Input \ud83d\udceb an \ud83d\udc4f ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 too fast \ud83d\ude84\u231a and \ud83d\udca6 you lose the \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udffb Auto attack. \ud83e\udd3c \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Input an ability \ud83d\udc49 too slow \ud83d\ude33 and you \ud83d\ude0d lose \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab DPS. \u2b25 These \u2620 two \u270c\u270c reasons are why \ud83e\udd14\u2049 5taa is \ud83d\ude29\u2139 a \ud83d\udc53\ud83d\udc4c situational technique though \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 it \ud83d\ude35 is still \ud83d\ude44 worth \ud83c\udf10\ud83d\udcb5 mentioning. Deviating Upgrade Paths Two Roads Diverged in a Yellow Wood Note: As with any upgrade path, feel free to ask any questions you have in #unknown-channel \u2b25The \ud83c\udf6b\ud83c\udfde prioritization of upgrades can \ud83d\udca6 vary depending on what \ud83d\ude26 your \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udc40 focus \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude29 is \ud83d\udc4f with \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udc4f PvM. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude1c remaining \ud83d\udd75 upgrades are \ud83d\udea5\ud83d\udc76 also \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc68 very expensive, \ud83d\udcb5 varying from \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc4a 100m to 1b. \u2b25 If you will be primarily doing Vorago or Solak, it is recommended to pick up a Greater Barge codex . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Its special affect allows you to turn channeled abilities into bleeds. \u2b25 If \ud83d\ude80 you're \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude0d more \ud83c\udf57 interested \ud83d\ude0d in \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf19 bosses such \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude32 as \ud83c\udfff\ud83c\udfff Angel \ud83d\udc7c of \ud83c\udf96 Death, Raids - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, or \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude2b faster \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25 kills \ud83d\udc80 at \ud83c\udf54 Araxxor, it \ud83e\udd14 is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udca6 recommended to \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\ude36 buy a \ud83d\udc4c\u27a1 Zaros Godsword. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Its \ud83d\ude45\ud83d\ude2b extremely \ud83d\udc9b\ud83c\udfc6 powerful \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udca1 special \ud83d\ude02 attack greatly improves your \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udd71 sustained DPM. \u2b25 At \ud83c\udf46\u2757 high \ud83d\ude43 defense bosses such as \ud83c\udfff Vorago, Angel \ud83d\udc7c\ud83d\ude07 of Death, \ud83c\udfb2\ud83d\uddff and Raids \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 - Beastmaster & Yakamaru, it is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udca6 recommended to \ud83d\udca6 pick \u26cf\u26cf up \ud83c\udd99 a Statius' Warhammer. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude05 has \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udf89 special \ud83c\udf81\u2708 attack \u2694 which significantly lowers defences for 1 minute. \u23f0\u231a \u2b25 In \ud83d\udc47 the \ud83d\ude0a\u27a1 end \ud83d\udd1a you \ud83d\udc66 should aim to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude0b grab \u270b\ud83d\udc2d all \ud83c\udfde\ud83d\udc47 three \ud83d\udc68 of these upgrades. Zaros Godsword \u2b25 The Zaros Godsword is a T92 2H melee weapon noteworthy for its powerful Special Attack 'Blackhole'. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Blackhole is a DPS buff - essentially a Sunshine or Death's Swiftness for melee - which uses 50% Adrenaline (45% with Vigour ), buffs damage by 25% and lasts for 20 seconds. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It \ud83d\ude11\ud83c\udf5d should be \ud83d\ude45 used in rotation with \ud83d\udc4f Berserk (ie. use \ud83d\udc4f Blackhole when Berserk is \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude07 on cooldown) OR \ud83d\udcb0 when \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc95 the \u274c\ud83c\udf46 situation \ud83e\udd20\ud83d\udc4a is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 too dangerous \u2620 to Berserk in. Note that you do not need to keep ZGS equipped once you've activated its special attack. Also note that ZGS does not have scythe range. \u2b25 ZGS rotations are \ud83d\udc87 similar \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc71 to Berserk rotations but \ud83c\udf51 vary based on \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udcaf the boss. \u2b25 As for \ud83c\udf46 adrenaline \ud83d\udc89 potions, it \u2714\ud83d\udd27 is \ud83d\udcb0 recommended to \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc49 save adrenaline \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 potions for \u231b Berserk as \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc49 it \u270b\ud83d\udcaf is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 more \ud83d\ude45\u2795 valuable in \ud83d\udcc5 Berserk with \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2b its higher \ud83d\udd1d damage \u2604 modifier. Berserk + Adrenaline Potion / Limitless Sigil \u2192 Berserk Cooldown \u2192 ZGS Special \u2192 ZGS Cooldown \u2192 Repeat Statius' Warhammer \u2b25 One of the more powerful aspects of melee in group pvm is access to the SWH special attack without the need for an Ingenuity of the Humans ability . \u2b25 If \ud83c\udfc3 you \u2640 intend to do \ud83d\udc95 group PvM it is \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude02 recommended to \ud83c\udffe\ud83c\udffc buy \ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb0 a \ud83d\udcaf SWH and \u2795 use \ud83d\udc4f its special \u2708\ud83d\udc69 attack at \ud83e\udd34 high defence bosses (eg. \ud83c\udd7e\ud83c\udd71 Vorago, Yakamaru, Beast \ud83d\ude0b Master, Angel \ud83d\udc7c of \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc6c Death). \u2b25 Usage of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc49 the SWH varies from \ud83c\udffc boss \ud83d\udcbc\ud83c\udffb to \ud83d\udcb2\u26ea boss \ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc68 and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f will \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb0 be \ud83d\udc1d\u274c covered more specifically \ud83d\udd35 in \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udc4f our \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc67 boss \ud83d\udc68 guides. Greater Barge \u2b25 Greater Barge can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Barge Ability Codex and transforms your lesser Barge ability to Greater Barge. \u2b25 The \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\ude46 description of Greater Barge is as \ud83d\udd50\ud83c\udfa3 follows: Greater \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 barge requires the \ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udffb player \ud83c\udfae\ud83c\udfae to stop \u270b\u270b attacking their target for \ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf84 3 \u2764\ud83d\ude27 seconds \ud83d\udd5a (8 \ud83d\udc4a ticks, roughly 2 \ud83d\udca6 GCD). At this \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc49 point, \ud83d\udd18 the greater barge icon \ud83d\udd14\ud83d\udd14 will \ud83d\udd95\ud83d\ude2c show \ud83c\udfa4\ud83d\udc40 up on \ud83d\udc47 your buff bar. \ud83d\ude2b This \u2753 indicates that the \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udd0d gbarge buff \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa is \ud83e\udd22 ready \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude0d to \u26ab be \ud83d\udc1d activated.

At \ud83c\udf46 any \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udca6 point during \ud83d\udea3\ud83d\udea3 these \ud83d\udc48\u2600 10 \ud83d\udcaf ticks any channeled ability you \ud83d\udc48 cast will \ud83d\udc6b become a damage-over-time bleed \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udc89 instead. \ud83d\ude94 https://youtu.be/GPPMjY2wrjw \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd11 \u2b25 This effect is \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udffb EXTREMELY \ud83d\ude2c\ud83c\udfc6 powerful and can create \ud83d\udcf2 lots of \ud83d\udcaf\u271d burst DPS. \u2b25 It \ud83d\ude02 is \ud83c\udf45 also \ud83d\ude12 extremely \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude02 useful in \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udecc any \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udca6 scenarios where you \u261d\ud83d\udc49 are \ud83d\udd22 forced to \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udcb0 stop attacking \ud83e\udd3c due \ud83d\udc45 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc4f a \ud83c\udd71 mechanic (eg. \ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udd7e reflecting Web at \u2642\ud83d\udc62 Araxxor, phasing at \u263a Yakamaru pools, \ud83c\udfca\ud83c\udfca reflects at \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc78 Vorago, phasing at \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udf46 Solak, etc) as \ud83d\udc8e\ud83c\udfff these \ud83c\ude34\ud83d\udca6 downtimes allow \u2601\ud83c\udfab for \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc3b Greater \ud83d\udc45 Barge to proc its waiting \u231a\u231a initial effect. \ud83d\udc06\ud83d\udc06 \u2b25 The applications of \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udffb this \u261d are \ud83d\udc4f explored moreso in our \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude9f specific boss \ud83d\udcbc guides but \ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\udc4f generally \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude04 it is \ud83d\ude9f\ud83d\udca6 used as \ud83c\udd71 follows: Wait 5 ticks to proc Greater Barge \u2192 Barge Target \u2192 Activate channeled threshold (eg.

Notes on gBarge \u2b25 Multiple people can stack a \ud83c\udffb gBarge 'bleed' \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\ude33 on \ud83d\udcf1 the same \ud83d\udca9 target and \ud83d\udcb0\u2795 they \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude4e will \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc4a not \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude45 override each \ud83d\udc4f other. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc6a \u2b25 Equipping a \ud83c\udf46 different \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc49 tier weapon \ud83d\udd2b after \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\udc40 you \ud83e\udd1d apply the bleed \ud83d\ude33 will change \ud83d\udd01\ud83d\ude29 the \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udc6e bleed's \ud83d\udc89 damage \u2620\u2620 according \ud83d\udd1b to the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude9f latter weapon \ud83d\udde1 tier. \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc51 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd53 example, \ud83d\udd25 if you \ud83d\udc42\ud83d\udc6f apply \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude24 the \ud83d\udca6 gBarge bleed with \ud83d\udc4f Drygores (t90) equipped, then \ud83c\udd71 switch to \ud83d\udc6c\u27a1 ZGS (t92) the \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\udcbb damage \u2620 will \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc59 be \ud83e\udd13\ud83c\udfff calculated \ud83d\udcd3 as a \ud83d\ude3c\ud83d\ude9f t92 weapon. \u2b25 If \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc7b the initial weapon \u2694 has \ud83d\udcb0 a special effect \ud83d\udce3\ud83d\udc06 against \ud83d\udc49 a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc66 target, the \ud83d\udc4f effect can \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udd2b activate after \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc4a you \ud83d\udc91\ud83d\ude47 switch \ud83c\udf9a to \ud83d\udca6 another \ud83d\udcfa\ud83c\udffb weapon. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For example, apply a gBarge bleed with Terrasaur Maul then switching to Khopeshes will apply its special buff against Ranged monsters during its bleed calculations, to give T92 + 12.5% damage, rather than T80 + 12.5%. \u2b25 During \ud83d\udea3 Yakamaru's Stun Pool, \ud83c\udf0a mbarging a \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc7b Destroy \u26a1 ability \ud83d\udc49 will \ud83d\udca3 still \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d apply its \ud83d\ude19\ud83d\ude2b stun effect for \ud83c\udf45\ud83d\udcb0 the \ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd23 entire \ud83c\udf2a\ud83d\udcaf 4 \ud83c\udff3\ud83d\udca6 hits. This can be \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc1d a \ud83d\udcb0 costly mistake. \u2b25 Akin to \ud83d\udca6 note 2, \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96 switching \ud83d\udd25 to a flanking weapon during the \ud83d\ude08 gBarge bleed \ud83d\udc89 effect \ud83d\udce3 will null the stun effect. \ud83d\udc06\ud83d\udc06 \u2b25 Normally Vorago will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc6b clear \ud83d\udd0e\ud83d\udcdd bleeds at the \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udc4f start \u25b6\ud83d\udd79 of \ud83d\udd0d its Reflect mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Since gBarge is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd14 not \u274c\ud83d\udeab a \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c true bleed, \ud83d\ude33 it \u2328\ud83d\ude21 will \ud83e\udd14 not \ud83d\ude45\u2716 clear \ud83d\udcdd the \ud83d\udd25\u270a bleed \ud83d\ude33 effect. \ud83d\udce3 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This \u2642\ud83d\udc48 makes \u2699\ud83d\udc4f it \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\udcaf very \u26ea\u2623 easy to \ud83d\udc35 PK teammates if \ud83d\udc4f you have miscounted auto \ud83e\udd16 attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Use with \ud83c\udffc caution \u270b\u26a0 at \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc62 Vorago. \u2b25 There \u2714\ud83d\udc4c is \ud83d\udcaf currently \u231a\u231a a \ud83c\udd7f\ud83d\ude2c glitch that prevents \u274e\ud83d\ude45 the \u2620\ud83d\udc49 gBarge bleed \ud83d\ude33 effect \ud83d\udc06 from \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc4c procing, despite \ud83d\ude45 having \ud83d\udc6c been outside of combat \ud83d\udde1\ud83e\udd3c for the required \ud83d\udccb\ud83d\udccb duration. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It is \ud83e\udd22\ud83d\ude40 currently thought to \ud83c\udf31 be caused by being \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude11 out \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udc45 of combat \ud83d\udde1\ud83e\udd3c for \ud83c\udf85 10 \ud83d\ude30 seconds \ud83d\ude2b with \ud83d\ude23\ud83d\udc4f no target, then \u231a re-entering combat \ud83d\udd2b with \ud83d\ude05 gBarge, though the causes of \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udca6 this \u2642 glitch is \ud83d\ude40 still \ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\udca2 unclear. Greater Fury \u2b25 Greater \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 Fury can \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udcb0 be \ud83d\ude29 unlocked through \ud83d\uddfa consuming a \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udcb0 Greater \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 Fury \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 Ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 Codex. \u2b25 This \ud83d\udc48 does two \ud83d\udc8f\ud83d\udc8f things: \ud83c\udf1a\ud83e\udd10 1) \ud83d\udca1\ud83c\udf87 Fury \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 is \ud83c\udfb6 no longer \ud83d\ude16 a channeled ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 and \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udde3 instead \u2642 only hits \ud83c\udfaf once \u261d dealing \ud83d\udc66\ud83c\udffe 157% ability \ud83d\udc49 damage, \u2620\u2620 and \ud83d\udd1b 2) \u26c5 gains an extra \ud83d\udde3\ud83d\udde3 effect where \ud83d\ude3e getting \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude21 a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcb0 critical hit \ud83d\udc4a with Fury \ud83d\ude21 will \ud83d\ude2e guarentee your next \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udf28 hit to \ud83d\ude31 be \ud83d\udc1d a \ud83d\ude29 crit as \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc66 well. \ud83d\ude02 \u2b25 The main benefit \ud83d\ude29 to \ud83d\udca6 this upgrade is \ud83d\ude33 transforming this ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 from \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd43 a channeled ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb1 a \ud83d\udc4c gcd ability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This \u2753 allows fury \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 to be used \ud83c\udfed in revo++ and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude35 revolution \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udd2b set ups without needing a manual input \ud83d\udebe to cancel on \u270b gcd. \u2b25 The crit effect \ud83d\udc06\ud83d\udc06 can \ud83c\udd71 also \ud83d\ude12\u2795 be \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udd71 beneficial to overall DPS though \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udc49 it \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udf46 is \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udd25 random. \ud83c\udfb2\ud83c\udfb2 Greater Flurry \u2b25 Greater \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 Flurry can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Flurry Ability \ud83d\udc49 Codex. \u2b25 The \ud83d\udcb4 effect \ud83d\udc06 states: \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c Perform \ud83c\udfad\u261d a \ud83c\udfeb flurry of \ud83d\udd0c blows against your \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udfe7 surrounding targets, dealing \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc66 up to \ud83d\ude02 94% weapon \u2694\ud83d\udde1 damage per \ud83d\udc7c hit \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc4a over \ud83e\udd12\ud83d\udca6 3.6 \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udcaf seconds. \ud83d\ude2b If \ud83d\udc4f only one \ud83d\ude24 target is nearby, up \u2b06\ud83d\udc40 to 157% weapon \ud83d\udde1\u203c damage \u2604 per hit \ud83d\udd1e\ud83d\udc4a will be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d dealt instead. \ud83d\udd16\ud83d\ude94 Additionally \u270f if \ud83d\udc4f\u2696 an \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude12 attack \ud83e\udd3c hits \ud83d\udc4a any \ud83d\udca6 target per \ud83d\udc7c\ud83d\udc7c swing, the \ud83c\udf2b\ud83d\udc4f cooldown of \ud83d\ude8b\ud83d\ude0a Berserk will \u2753 be reduced by \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\udd25 1.2 seconds each \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f swing. \u2b25 Once you've \ud83d\udc48 unlocked this \ud83d\ude15 threshold, \ud83e\udd1d\ud83e\udd1d it becomes \ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9 your 3rd \ud83d\udc40 best \ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\udc4c threshold \ud83e\udd1d\ud83e\udd1d in \u2640 Berserk. \u2b25 In \ud83d\udc4f addition, its \ud83d\udc4c unique \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc70 effect \ud83d\udce3 of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude33 reducing Berserk cooldown is \ud83d\udc4f very \u2640\ud83c\udffd useful in \ud83d\ude29\ud83c\udffc overall Melee rotations. \u2b25 There \ud83d\udeac\u2714 are \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\ude0e several \ud83d\udd1f ways of \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udd71 using \ud83c\udffb GFlurry. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can either \ud83d\ude0c cancel \u274c it \ud83d\udeb0 on GCD (ie. 2 \ud83d\udc81 hits) for \ud83d\udd04\ud83d\udc40 burst damage, \u2604 or use it \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udcaf for its \ud83d\ude45 entire duration for \ud83d\udc4f its \ud83d\udcde\ud83c\udf0f Berserk reduction effect. \ud83d\udce3\ud83d\udc06 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udd0e you bleed \ud83d\udc89 this \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc48 threshold \ud83e\udd1d\ud83e\udd1d using \ud83d\udce4 gBarge, all \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude44 bleed hits \ud83c\udfaf\ud83d\udc4a will contribute towards reducing Berserk's cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is \ud83d\ude0d used extensively at Aod and \ud83d\udcb0 Solak where \ud83d\udc4b players \u2639\ud83c\udfae want \u2640 to \ud83c\udd71\u27a1 Berserk as \ud83d\udc66\ud83c\udf51 often as \ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udfff possible \ud83d\udd1d through \ud83d\udc49\u23ec out the \ud83d\ude2b\u26ea fight. \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udca5 Remaining Upgrades \u2b25 At \ud83c\udf54 this stage, all \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude40 important upgrades have \ud83d\udd12 been obtained and \ud83d\udc4f all \ud83d\udcaf that \u27a1\ud83d\ude10 remains \u2642 is \ud83d\udc4f to \u2620 get inherent DPM boosting upgrades. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Following this, buy \ud83d\udcb5 either Khopeshes or \ud83d\udcb0 a \u2754 T99 Codex, depending

\ud83d\udc1d a \ud83d\ude29 crit as \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc66 well. \ud83d\ude02 \u2b25 The main benefit \ud83d\ude29 to \ud83d\udca6 this upgrade is \ud83d\ude33 transforming this ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 from \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd43 a channeled ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb1 a \ud83d\udc4c gcd ability. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 This

\ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udf46 is \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udd25 random. \ud83c\udfb2\ud83c\udfb2 Greater Flurry \u2b25 Greater \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 Flurry can be unlocked through consuming a Greater Flurry Ability \ud83d\udc49 Codex. \u2b25 The \ud83d\udcb4 effect \ud83d\udc06 states: \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c Perform \ud83c\udfad\u261d a \ud83c\udfeb flurry of \ud83d\udd0c blows against your

\u2604 per hit \ud83d\udd1e\ud83d\udc4a will be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d dealt instead. \ud83d\udd16\ud83d\ude94 Additionally \u270f if \ud83d\udc4f\u2696 an \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude12 attack \ud83e\udd3c hits \ud83d\udc4a any \ud83d\udca6 target per \ud83d\udc7c\ud83d\udc7c swing, the \ud83c\udf2b\ud83d\udc4f cooldown of \ud83d\ude8b\ud83d\ude0a Berserk will \u2753 be reduced by \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\udd25 1.2 seconds each \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f swing. \u2b25 Once you've \ud83d\udc48 unlocked this \ud83d\ude15 threshold, \ud83e\udd1d\ud83e\udd1d it becomes \ud83d\udcc9\ud83d\udcc9 your 3rd \ud83d\udc40 best \ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\udc4c threshold \ud83e\udd1d\ud83e\udd1d in \u2640 Berserk. \u2b25 In \ud83d\udc4f addition, its \ud83d\udc4c unique \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc70 effect \ud83d\udce3 of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude33 reducing Berserk cooldown is \ud83d\udc4f very \u2640\ud83c\udffd useful in \ud83d\ude29\ud83c\udffc overall Melee rotations. \u2b25 There \ud83d\udeac\u2714 are \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\ude0e several \ud83d\udd1f ways of \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udd71 using \ud83c\udffb GFlurry. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 You can either

Building a Rotation \u2b25 When \ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udd71 building a \ud83d\udca9 rotation, ability prioritizations AND cooldowns should \ud83d\udc98 be \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc4f on \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udc4e your mind. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udca6 \u2b25 Filler abilities such as Needle Strike and Dazing Shot should be used in-between high damage abilities such as Snipe , Corruption Shot , Binding Shot-Flanking , and Fragmentation Shot-Walk . \u2b25 Any basic ability with damage lower than Needle/Dazing would be considered a weak ability, such as Piercing Shot , Tuska's Wrath , Sacrifice , Binding Shot without Flanking, Richochet on a single target. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Generally \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude04 speaking, these \ud83d\udc48 should be avoided \u2b25 If you are 2h or dual wield camping you will be limited to only one filler ability (Dazing Shot or Needle Strike , respectively). Thus, try to utilize Dazing Shot or Needle Strike as often as possible in your rotations. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 A basic pattern of Needle Strike \u2192 Ability \u2192 Ability \u2192 Repeat is recommended for camping rotations. \u2b25 For weapon juggling, you will have access to both Needle and Dazing as filler abilities.

Ruby Bolts Overall the best \ud83d\udc14 bols for \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udcbc general \ud83d\udc6e\u2642 PvM. A \ud83d\udc66 5% \ud83d\ude18\ud83c\udd71 chance to \ud83d\ude1b activate, replacing a hit \ud83d\udc4a with \ud83d\udcb0 a new \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udcaf one based \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\udd25 on \ud83d\uddd3\ud83c\udf46 target's HP. The bolts have a \ud83c\udf3c shared \ud83d\udc6c\ud83d\udc6c cooldown per target, making them less \u303d\u2796 effective (but still very \ud83d\udc4c powerful) \ud83d\udd0b in \ud83c\udf19 groups. The HP to \u26d4 switch \ud83c\udf9a at varies per \ud83d\udc7c\ud83d\udc7c target, and \ud83d\udce1 it \ud83d\udca1 is recommended to \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc49 switch \ud83c\udf9a\ud83d\udc91 to \ud83e\udd47\ud83d\udc42 another \ud83c\udfca type \u2328\u270d of \ud83c\udfe7\ud83e\udd24 bolt once \ud83c\udf46 the overriden hits are \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd22 lower \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e than \ud83d\udc49 expected. Note: Rubies are banned from combat dummy gems as its difficult to accurately measure your DPM with their effects. Onyx Bolts \u200e \u200e A 10% chance to activate, increasing damage by 25% on activation and healing for the same amount. Great for sustained healing, and alternative bolts after Rubies are no longer effective. Hydrix Bolts A 10% chance to activate, immediately granting 10% adren, and +1% on basics for 15 seconds. Used as a utility bolt for pumping out more thresholds while in Death's Swiftness . 130k/140k DPM Priorizing Thresholds \u2b25 At this stage it is very important to learn a good ultimate rotation. It is encouraged in a 5 minute gem to do 5 Death's Swiftness, if you haven't already, you should get a Planted Feet switch in order to gain +8 seconds on your Death's Swiftness. \u2b25 Learning \ud83e\udd17 which \ud83d\udc4c\ud83e\udd24 thresholds to prioritize and use in \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc4f an Ultimate is \ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude0d extremely \ud83e\udd24 important to \ud83d\udc50\ud83d\udca6 maximize your dpm.

Once flanking can be used, the threshold prioritization in ultimates is as follows: \u2b25 With \ud83d\udc7b\ud83c\udd95 Adrenaline \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 Potion: \ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf7e Snapshot \u200e \u200e> Rapid Fire > Shadow Tendrils > Tight Bindings > Snapshot > Rapid Fire \u2b25 Without \u274c\ud83d\udc4f Adrenaline \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 Potion: \ud83c\udf7e Snapshot > Shadow Tendrils > Rapid Fire > Snapshot > Tight Bindings \u2b25 Notes: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 We remove Bombardment from our threshold rotations as they are all replaced with Flanking . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Remember to use your Flanking switch for basics, not just for thresholds. Using it on Binding Shot improves that ability from 100% ability damage to 260% ability damage and is often overlooked by inexperienced players. Weapon Switching \u2b25 Once \ud83c\udff3\ud83d\udd25 you're at \ud83d\udc40 160k DPM, reaching higher \u2705 levels of DPM will \ud83d\udca7 require either \ud83d\ude21\u2642 lots \u2714\u2714 of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb0 min-max optimizations, or \ud83d\udc81 incorporating weapon switching. \ud83d\udd25 \u2b25 Assuming you have been DW camping until this point, obtaining an SGB or a Decimation bow will allow you to DW/2H switch without switching ammo. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Start focusing on never using an ability worse than 157% ability damage. Any Tuska's Wrath or Sacrifice in your rotation should be swapped for a Dazing Shot . \u2b25 Maintain the same threshold order in Death's Swiftness and remember to Needle Strike before Snap Shot and Shadow Tendrils for higher damage. \u2b25 From this \u2b06 point \ud83d\udd18 onwards we \ud83d\udc76\ud83d\udc75 will also \u2795 incorporate ways \ud83d\ude09\ud83e\udd14 to force auto \ud83e\udd16 attacks. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For Death's Swiftness, using a dw MH for Planted Feet then switching to 2H will also force an auto attack, which can contribute significant damage. Sometimes clicking your target is necessary to force the auto attack. The sequence of actions goes as follows: \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Equip DW PF \u2192 Activate Death's Swiftness \u2192 Equip 2h within GCD \u2192 Click target (auto attack will come out here) \u2192 Activate Ability. \u2b25 Using Shadow Tendrils with 2H after using a DW ability with a 'fastest' speed weapon allows for stacking an auto on top of the tendrils. 170/180k+ DPM Bakriminel Switching \u2b25 If \ud83d\udc4f you \ud83d\udc75\ud83d\ude30 would like to progress further up \u2764 you will \ud83d\udc4f have \ud83c\ude36\ud83d\udc45 to \ud83d\udcb0 learn \ud83d\udc68 Bakriminel Bolt switching. \u2b25 Various bolts provide \ud83d\udcb0 a \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0 variety of effects which \ud83d\udc4f\u2753 can \ud83d\udc44 be \ud83e\udd13\ud83d\udc1d useful under \u2b07 different \ud83c\udffc\u2194 circumstances \u274c\u274c . Since Rubies are our \ud83d\ude9f primary bolt and have \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0f an innate cooldown, we \ud83c\udfc3 can bypass any \ud83e\udd37 downtime by \ud83c\udf6d\ud83d\udc7c switching to \ud83d\udc42\u270c another \ud83d\udc63\ud83c\udffb bolt to \u26a0\ud83d\udca6 get the \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f most \ud83d\ude24\u2795 out \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude32 of their \ud83d\ude0d\u2b55 effects at \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udc45 any \ud83d\udca6 given \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc64 time. \ud83d\udd51 \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Bolt switches are \ud83d\udd22\ud83d\udc13 usually done between \u2b05 the \ud83d\udd1a\ud83d\udc4f three meta bolts: Ruby, Onyx, and \ud83c\udf46 Hydrix. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- The idea is to \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udcac pick two \ud83d\udc8f or \ud83d\ude24 three \ud83d\udc81 bolts for \ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udffd a \ud83c\udd70\ud83d\ude24 given \u2935 scenario to minimize downtime between \ud83c\udf7c bolt cooldowns and \ud83d\ude4c to \u2721\ud83e\udd23 maximize their \ud83d\udca6 effects. \u2b25 For example, the most effective bolt when fighting #nex-duo are Ruby bolts as they are the best dps bolts. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 However, when attacking minions the most effective bolt becomes Hydrix as minions have a soft hitcap of 1000 so any Ruby procs are wasted. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- During the last phase, the most effective bolt on Nex becomes Onyx as she is lower than 100k hp thus reducing Ruby's effectiveness.

How It Works \u2b25 To get your Auto with Shadow Tendrils you must perform a non-channeled fastest speed weapon ability before Tendrils . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 For example, Needle with Blightbound Crossbows . \u2b25 To further make use of this interaction, you want to ensure that this Auto is a 2h-Auto, such as SGB or ECB , or Dbow (where accuracy permits). \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 To do this, simply swap to your 2h after your ability before Tendrils , or swap to your 2h directly as you or after you cast Tendrils . Differences From Typical Non-Damaging Abilities As \u2620\ud83c\udfff mentioned prior, \ud83d\udd19 there are \ud83d\udcb0 some caveats to \ud83d\udca6 this \ud83d\ude99 ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 and \u2622 they \ud83d\udc65\ud83d\ude02 are \ud83d\udd22 as \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udcb0 follows: \ud83c\udfc3\u2640 \u2b25 You cannot delay the Auto with Tendrils like other Defensive Autos. \u2b25 Fast speed weapons do \ud83d\udc4c not \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude45 work like with \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude09 other \ud83d\udc68 Defensive Autos. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Thus, the non-channeled ability before Tendrils must be fastest. \u2b25 You have to spam click if you want to get Auto after Tendrils if you offed for some reason before it, though clicking once before Tendrils works too.","title":"Dpm advice \ud83d\udc4f range"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-range/#dpm-advice-range","text":"","title":"Dpm advice \ud83d\udc4f range"},{"location":"pvme-guides/dpm-advice/dpm-advice-range/#introduction","text":"In \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4f RuneScape PvM, the \ud83e\udd34\ud83d\udd61 meta at \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udf46 the time \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udcaa of \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udca6 writing is \ud83c\ude36\ud83d\udca6 about pushing out \ud83c\udf46 as \ud83d\udc4d much \ud83d\ude40 damage \u2604 in \u303d\ud83d\udc48 as \ud83d\udc66\ud83c\udf51 little time \ud83d\ude4f as \ud83e\udd14 possible. \ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d It \u26d4 is \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude17 important \ud83e\udd23 to \ud83c\udfff understand \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0f that \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc63 good \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c and \ud83d\ude1f efficient PvM, especially at \ud83d\udc49 the \ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\uddef higher \u2705\u2705 tiers, is \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udd25 about \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd14 squeezing out as \ud83d\udd95\ud83c\udf51 much \ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude29 damage \u2604 as \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\ude0e possible \ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d in between \ud83d\udc49 mechanics.

It is \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc49 recommended to \ud83d\udca6 have some decently leveled gear (level \ud83c\udf52 50+ in a trio should \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\ude11 be fine), since exp gained is \ud83c\udd71 based on \ud83c\udffd damage \u2620 dealt. Find \u2714 teams to \ud83d\udc4f do \u2642 this \ud83d\udcec with in \ud83d\udce5 the \ud83c\udff3 servers mentioned alongside the charming imp above.

The ED3 method is more \ud83d\ude16 beginner \ud83d\udc76\ud83d\udc76 friendly. Slayer \ud83c\udf46 Your second option is Slayer.

Note for both pet tanks: You want your pet facing away from the DPS pile and tanks so that they do not use auto attacks on them and your team can use flanking on them.

The fight requires 115 Slayer (boostable) and a Key to the Crossing for each kill attempt. He is primarily killed for his Phylactery drops, which are used to create the t92 melee Khopeshes of Tumeken and Elidinis . It is highly recommended to have at least t90 weapons and to be on a berserker aura, as his defence is high. Being on a Soul Devourer task will boost Tuska's Wrath damage to the boss, however the Slayer Helm and Genocidal perk effects do not work. Drops \u2b07 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Vital Spark 1/64 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Phylactery 1/18 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Gloves of Passage 1/500 \u2b25 \u200e \u200e Soul Fragment 1/1000 (200 threshold) Presets General \u2b25 Bring \u27a1 as many \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udcaf keys \ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd11 as you're comfortable with. When starting out \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udd1c you \ud83d\udc4f can \u263a have more \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf65 food \ud83c\udf5f\ud83c\udf57 and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd24 less \ud83d\ude14 keys, but \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udf51 food \ud83c\udf2e should \ud83d\udc98\ud83d\ude0e generally \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude04 be \ud83d\udc68 removed. \ud83d\uddd1\u274c With max gear you \u267b will \ud83d\udc4f have 100% \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf hit chance, so \u26a1\ud83d\udeab a ripper demon \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc7a is \ud83c\udf75\ud83d\udc4c recommended. If you \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc64 have lower \ud83d\ude45\ud83d\ude0e tier \ud83d\udc51 gear, a \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0d nihil is recommended. \u2b25 Additionally, a Luck of the Dwarves is viable at Magister, as it improves the phylactery drop rate from 1/18 to 1/17, which can save the player 30 kills on average while making a full Khopesh. This is roughly equal to a 10% increase in gross profit. \u2b25 Vital spark drop enhancers will also increase your profits, since Magister will uncommonly drop vital sparks . It awards an additional vital spark upon receiving one as a drop, and is consumed in the process. They are obtained from Bryll Thoksdottir's reward shop for 1000 Dungeoneering tokens each. \u2b25 It is recommended to bring 2 super restores . However if you get fast enough kills, the HP drain doesn't matter and you can use spiritual prayers instead.

This attack deals ranged damage and can either be ignored or partially negated by flicking to Deflect Missiles or by using Disruption Shield . If you are struggling for food on trips you can use Resonance . This attack is 100% accurate and deals ~2300 damage unmitigated. Barge This \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude06 mechanic is signaled by \u23e9\ud83d\ude9f the voice \ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udde3 line \ud83d\ude4b\u3030 \"You \ud83d\udca8\ud83c\udffe dare fight \ud83d\ude4f me?\" After a \ud83c\udd70\ud83d\udc4c 1.8s delay, the Magister will \ud83e\udd14 barge to \ud83d\udd35 1 \u27a1 sq south \ud83d\udc47 of \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udca6 player's location, \ud83d\udc4c\u2714 dealing \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udeac around \u21aa\ud83d\udc65 2300 melee damage \u2620\u2620 in a \ud83c\udf51 5x5 area and \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc4f disabling protection \ud83e\udd4a\ud83d\udee1 prayers for a \ud83d\udcb0 small \u23ec duration. This \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude15 can \ud83d\udca6 be \ud83d\udc4f avoided by moving out \ud83d\ude1e\u2197 of \ud83d\udca6 the way, it \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udd0c is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 recommended you \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude07 move \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0e north as \ud83d\ude05\ud83c\udf51 this \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udd34 gives you a \ud83d\udc4c 1.2s \u2b07 time \u23f0\ud83d\udd50 window to \ud83d\udc42 react, \u2702\u2702 moving east or \ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udfa1 west leaves you \u267b with only \ud83d\udc4f 0.6s \ud83d\ude0f and \u274c to \ud83d\udc49 dodge it \ud83d\udcaf\ud83e\udd14 by \ud83d\ude08 running south is always \ud83d\udcaf an \ud83d\udcb0 accident \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude93 as \ud83d\ude30 you \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc46 already \ud83d\ude1e have \ud83d\ude0f to \ud83d\udeb6\ud83d\udca6 be \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udcaa running \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude30 that \u274c\ud83d\ude1d way \u2642\ud83d\ude2b when \ud83c\udf51 the mechanic starts. \ud83d\udd79\ud83d\udd79 If you \ud83c\udfe5\ud83d\udc48 find this \ud83d\ude02 time \u203c window \ud83d\udcbb\ud83c\udfd9 small, resonance or \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude8b simply \ud83d\ude21 ignoring \ud83e\udd10\ud83e\udd10 it \ud83d\udcaf is an \ud83d\udc0e\ud83d\udc95 easier way \ud83d\udca6 of \ud83d\udc4f dealing with \ud83d\ude02 this \ud83d\ude9f mechanic. \u2b25 Resonance is also a good option if you wish to make the most of a channel such as Rapid Fire or Asphyxiate but can not afford to lose the lifepoints to face tank the barge. Melee should use Disruption Shield to mitigate this mechanic losslessly, the healing is unnecessary with the use of a scrimshaw of vampyrism. \u2b25 Move \u2642 1 square away \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\ude2d afterwards, as being \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude2f melee distance to the \u2620 boss \ud83d\udcbc can \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udd2b trigger \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udd2b the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude08 following mechanic. Stand Still The Magister will yell \"Stand still!\" and stun the player for 4.2s, dealing ~2300 melee damage before dashing away in a random direction. It's possible for this combo damage to be very high as he will immediately do a mage attack after escaping, if you do get hit, use Freedom and pray Deflect Magic . This is avoided by simply not standing in melee range of the boss, but if the player is using melee, they should use a halberd at 2 tile range at lower skill levels. Another method is to step away from Magister when he may do a special attack, his ability to do rapid consecutive actions can make this difficult and therefore requires high skill and insight to do well. This mechanic replaces the \"Barge\" mechanic while the player is in melee distance. This mechanic is instant and thus cannot be reacted to proactively, this makes resonance not an option. Unstable Mixture A bomb \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca6 will \ud83d\udcb0 be thrown in \u2934\ud83d\udc4f the general \ud83d\udc6e\ud83d\udc6e vicinity of \ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udca6 the player \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udfae and \u2795 will explode \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca5 after the \ud83d\udc4f bar \ud83e\udd43\ud83d\ude2b above \ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d it \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude0d fills, dealing typeless damage \u2604 in \ud83d\udc89 a 5x5 area, if caught \ud83d\udd0d in \ud83d\udc6e\ud83c\udf51 the \ud83d\udc67\ud83c\udfe0 radius this \ud83d\udc48 is \ud83c\udd71 4000 damage to \ud83d\udc49 the player, 4000 damage \u2620 to \ud83d\ude26\u270c the \u264b magister (multiplied by \ud83d\ude08 vuln) and \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc4f 2000 damage \u2604 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udffb the player's \ud83d\udcc5\ud83d\udcb0 familiar.

These deal moderate damage and \ud83c\udffd it is \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udca6 recommended to kill them \u2640 unless \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f the fight \u270a\ud83d\udcaf is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udcaf at \ud83d\udc52 least halfway over, melee spawns can \ud83d\udd2b be \ud83d\udc66\u27a1 kited with \ud83d\udcb0 ranged and magic. \u2b25 To minimise your chances of receiving this mechanic you should focus on having high DPS to reset his action counter to 3 as fast as possible (at 150k, 100k and 50k) before he has a chance to use a special attack on some of these phases. Stun-locking the magister and stunning him in general can be very helpful to this end. This makes dreadnips a very powerful ally, especially for players with lower DPS. The stuns they provide can also be used to boost the damage of Slice , Punish , Wrack and Piercing Shot for free, and also cause you to take less damage. Note: Players with consistent kill times less than 1 minute should never see this special. \u2b25 If \ud83d\ude44\ud83c\udffe the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udd71 player \ud83c\udfcb\u2640 finds they are \ud83d\udc4f taking too much \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude29 damage, they can \ud83d\udca6 use \ud83d\ude02 a \ud83d\udc4c feather of \ud83d\udca6 Ma'at \ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc69 to \ud83d\udcb0 cleanse \ud83d\udec1 their corruption and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc83 gain \ud83d\udcaa some breathing room, \ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\udeaa this \ud83d\ude9f\ud83d\udd96 does however \ud83e\udd14 make \ud83d\ude2c the next \ud83c\udf28 kill or \ud83d\udc81 two \ud83d\udc8f slower, \ud83d\ude29 if \u2757\ud83d\udc4f the \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc4f player \ud83d\udc68 has \ud83d\udeb8 to resort to this \ud83c\udf51\u2b07 consistently, it \u25b6\u2754 is recommended they \u2728 practice \ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46 their \ud83c\udf77\ud83d\ude46 DPS more \ud83d\ude24\u270b before \ud83d\udcb0 continuing. Note: The Magister will deal more damage when below 50,000 lifepoints, resulting in some of these attacks dealing damage in the mid 3000s. Strategy General \u2b25 Avoid using high damaging abilities like Tuska's Wrath , Wild Magic , Snap Shot etc. while the boss is slightly above 150k, 100k, and 50k hp as he will absorb any extra damage dealt to reach those exact numbers. Damage is counted towards progressing phases before truncation. This can be most easily observed in damage boosting ultimates with Tuska's Wrath , where it may hit 20k+ in zerk but is instead truncated to 15k, you can phase the boss from 170k HP and he will phase at 155k, this can apply to Assault hits under Berserk and Detonate / Guthix Staff EoF under Sunshine as well. Using this to your advantage can help reduce damage lost to phase caps. \u2b25 Magister's phasing is \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udca6 based \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\ude32 on \ud83d\udc8b\ud83c\udffc him \ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\udc8f attempting to auto attack \ud83e\udd3c\u2694 or taking \ud83d\udc85 a \ud83c\udf6c hit \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc4a of \ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd24 damage \u2604 within \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude31 attack range (which \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f is \ud83d\udc4c instead mitigated), as \ud83c\udfff such, if \ud83c\udfc3 you are \u2753 outside of \ud83c\udf39\ud83d\udca6 his \ud83d\udc68 attack \ud83e\udd3c\ud83e\udd3c range, \ud83e\udd24 he \ud83d\udc68\ud83e\udd34 will \ud83d\udc44\u26bd not \u2642 phase. \ud83c\udf12 This \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc40 only really applies to \ud83d\udca6 the SGB and \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4f Noxious longbow at \u2757 9 tiles when \ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf51 he is \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udffc bound. \ud83e\udd10 This \u261d also \u2795 has the \ud83d\udcd6 implication that \ud83d\ude10 he sometimes \ud83d\ude0f will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd14 phase \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\udcb0 few \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc47 ticks after reaching his HP threshold instead of instantly \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf which \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\udc4f is \ud83d\udc49 something \ud83d\udc4b to \ud83d\udca6 be aware \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c of. This \u2b06 means \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02 you should \ud83d\udc98\ud83d\ude15 be even \ud83c\udf03\u2796 more \ud83d\udc4c wary about using strong abilities around \u21aa his \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude24 HP thresholds, lest \ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1f they \ud83d\udd95 get mitigated. \u2b25 For \ud83c\udf46 corruption stacks, \ud83d\udca6 the speed of \ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\udca6 the \ud83d\udc48 last 50k doesn't matter \ud83c\udf1a as \ud83d\ude4c much \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd11 on \ud83d\udcb0 the \ud83d\udcac\ud83d\udcb0 first kill, \ud83d\ude00 do not \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude45 burst through it. \ud83d\udc8b This \ud83c\udf08 will \ud83d\udc44 allow \u2705\ud83c\udfab you \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc48 to \ud83d\ude2f have \ud83d\udc4f higher \u2705\ud83d\udd1d corruption stacks for \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc95 the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf3d 2nd and 3rd kill \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude29 for the entire \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udcaf kill, as such \ud83d\udcf6\ud83e\udd24 you'll \u2049 be doing \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udccc more damage \u2620 overall. However, \ud83d\udd90\ud83d\udd90 don't sandbag the \ud83d\udc67\ud83c\udd98 speed \u23e9 of the \ud83d\udcf2 kill. \ud83d\udd2a\ud83d\udc4f You want \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc4f to \u2642 kill him at \ud83d\udc40 pace \ud83c\udfc3 to \ud83d\udca6 hit 16-20% corruption by \ud83d\ude21 the \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\ude08 end \ud83d\udd1a of the first \ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47 kill. \u2b25 If \ud83d\udc4f you're \u270b\ud83d\udc48 getting fast \u2642 kills, \u2620\ud83d\udc80 don't \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab pick up \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udd3a your drop \ud83d\udd90 after the \ud83d\udcb0 kill, \ud83d\ude00\u26b0 pick \ud83e\udd17\u26cf it \ud83d\udca1 up \ud83d\ude0d during \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udfc3 your next \ud83d\udc49 one \ud83c\udffb or \ud83d\udc80 once \ud83c\udd71 every 2-3 kills in \ud83d\udc86\ud83d\ude1c a set. \ud83d\udc4c Magic (~80 KPH) Magister is not immune to stuns or binds although he possesses the ability to freedom occassionally. Despite this, a player doing proper 4TAA with ice spell auto attacks should be able to consider him near permanently bound for the purpose of using Bound Wrack to improve overall damage output. Ultimate Usage \u2b25 Start with a Sunshine and DPS while dealing with mechanics and Vuln bomb every kill. Depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary. Note: You want to around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of Magister (1 square away), this gives you ample space to avoid the Unstable Mixture while staying in your . \u2b25 Depending on the player's DPS, kill times can go down to 30 seconds. \u200e \u200eWith good DPS, the ideal is to chain across kills to maximize uptime, for example using for the last 100k HP of kill A then the first 100k HP of kill B. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Until you are comfortable chaining kills try not to below 60K HP. \u200e \u200eThis will ensure you maximize the value of Apot and Limitless . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 With good DPS and experience chaining kills, maximizing overall uptime should be prioritized at the cost of / value. Ability Prioritization \u2b25 If using mainly auto attacks or not using 4TAA \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Walked Combust and Corruption Blast is very strong and should be utilized heavily outside of . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Shock and Horror can be used to walk bleeds when your dreadnips stuns him at an unfortunate time. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- can be used in if you have extra adren, followed by a Bound . \u2b25 If using mainly auto attacks \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 allows for consistent usage of Bound -- a 188% basic with a 3s cooldown -- to greatly increase your damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 can trigger Magister's mechanic. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This is not an issue for the combo; however, it will lead to Magister commonly clearing bleeds. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- should be avoided as Magister will be consistently bound on top of the clear risk. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- is still strong due to its frontloaded damage. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- A good way to still use is to try to pop his immediately before using it with ability combinations such as \u2192 . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The Energizing perk does not actually decrease the damage of while providing consistent bonus adren. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- This makes the Energizing 4 perk BiS for mage Magister when utilizing -- replace either Enhanced Devoted or Invigorating. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e- Energizing is especially nice when siphoned at 100 adren right before activating as will always generate the 10 adren lost. Example Trip (Courtesy of #Akva) https://youtu.be/QHDzbE33r0A Melee (~85 KPH) For \ud83c\udf85 melee you'll \ud83c\udfb5 have \ud83c\ude36\ud83d\ude24 to be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udcb0 watching \ud83e\udd13 his \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udffb actions \ud83e\udd3c closely and \ud83d\udcb0 when \ud83d\udd5b you \ud83d\udd95 expect \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17 him \ud83d\udc74 to \ud83d\udca6 be \ud83d\udc4e able \ud83d\udcaa to spec, stall your \ud83d\udcaa\u2744 abilities outside \ud83d\udead\ud83d\ude0f of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 MD and \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc4f click \ud83d\uddb1\ud83d\uddb1 back \u2b05\ud83d\udcf5 onto \ud83d\udc26 him once he \ud83d\udc68 either \ud83d\ude24 performs his \ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd8a next \ud83d\udcc5\u2603 auto attack \ud83e\udd3c\u2694 or does \ud83c\udfcb his \ud83d\ude24 special \ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udf81 attack, \ud83e\udd3c when \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udd57 you \ud83d\udc4f click back \ud83d\ude0c on \ud83d\udd1b him \u2b06 to \ud83d\udca6 release your stalled ability, press your \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udc49 next \u23e9 ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 to \ud83c\udffb\u270c stack them \ud83d\ude24\u2764 on top \ud83d\udd3c\ud83d\udd3c of \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udfe7 eachother, this \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\uddd1 allows you to losslessly leave \u2640\ud83d\udc4e melee distance. You \ud83d\udc46 will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc8d develop an instinct/gut feeling \ud83e\udd12\ud83e\udd12 for \ud83d\udcb0\u231b this \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udd1c in time, \ud83d\udd57 however for \ud83e\udd14 beginners you \ud83d\udca6 will \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca3 be stunned alot. Alternatively, use a scythe and stand outside of \ud83d\udc19 melee distance. Kills \u2b25 Every other kill, Berserk + Adren Pot and do your berserk rotation, make use of Greater Barge if you can. Your aim is mostly to burst past phases so he doesn't get the chance to attempt a special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Then every other kill start the kill with a ZGS spec , if you are at 87%+ adrenaline at the start of the kill you may be able to make use of Greater Barge , however don't force the adrenaline at the end of the previous kill as forcing it won't be worth the 1.8s saved by the bleed. \u2b25 Threshold order: Destroy (or Hurricane ) first, Assault second (and Greater Flurry , if applicable, last) so that you can use destroy twice per kill without messing up your next kill's destroy cooldown, unlike if you tried to assault twice in a single kill then instantly in the next. \u2b25 Finish the kills with Slaughter and Blood Tendrils , as they do not benefit from being used inside ZGS/zerk and your other strong threshold abilities will be on CD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If your dreadnip stuns the magister when you slaughter, use Kick or Stomp to walk the bleed instead. \u2b25 In melee's case, the rotation is slightly more resilient, you will find yourself following this pattern on most, if not all, kills. However, if your DPS happens to be particularly good, you may find your adrenaline potion or limitless coming off cooldown ever so slightly too slow. For much of this, you can simply delay your zerk and use Greater Flurry /Destroy (depending on how long left you have on apot) then build back to Berserk . \u2b25 If you believe you'll fail to burst past a phase with Destroy for example, you can interrupt on the 3rd hit with Punish and run outside of melee distance on the same tick. Magister can attack before you get your 4th hit off, which also means he can spec and stun you out of your 4th hit as well as waste your time getting back to him, damaging you in the process. This is especially bad if you are in a ZGS spec and he dashes away from the area. However, you can keep channeling your through hits 3 and 4 even if you know a special attack is coming if you believe the 3rd hit will initiate the next phase, thus reseting his action counter back to 3 remaining attacks and removing the possibility of being stunned.

On the last kill of a trip, or if you think you're about to get a personal record, you can use to burst the last 50k. \u2b25 On the kills you Berserk , if 91%+ adren, target him, \u2192 \u2192 . After walking Slaughter , evaluate your adren and Magister's hp to see if thresholds can still be used and finish the kill with 75%+ adren. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 The first kill is rough since you haven't built up corruption yet, throw in a second Destroy if Magister is still 80k+ hp after walked Slaughtr . \u2b25 Dual wield Assault is important because the last hit when cancelled doesn't stack with another hit splat, as with 2h has the last hit stack with the ability you used to cancel. This helps in going over Magister's hard cap every 50k lp. \u2b25 Use Punish as a free 188 ability whenever he's stunned/rooted from dreadnips. \u2b25 Walk Slaughter by quickly stepping under him, if he's stunned use Kick . Following these \ud83c\udf46 rotations, with \u200e \u200egood perks and BiS \ud83d\udcaf gear, you \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude0d generally \ud83d\udc40 won't have to \ud83d\udcaf\u2620 worry \ud83d\ude47 about actual \u2757 mechanics \ud83d\udcb0 until the \ud83c\udf03 last \u23f3 50k hp, as \ud83d\udd51 if done \ud83d\udca6 right \ud83d\udc4c he will either be \ud83d\udc1d stunned \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude28 or \u2795\ud83c\udd71 you \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\udc67 do \ud83d\udc4f quick \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b enough \ud83e\udd19\ud83d\udc4f damage \u2620 between \u2b05\ud83d\ude09 every 50k hp he doesn't have time to \u2640 do a \ud83d\uded0\ud83d\udc4d special attack.

Again, depending on the player's DPS, timings after the first kill will vary. Note: Death's Swiftness around half way between his spawn point and the start pillar, and then stand 2 tiles north of magister (1 square away). \u2b25 Demoralise and Rout should not be used, as they lack the 10s bind which means you can't abuse Piercing Shot in tandem. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Sticky bombs can also be used to keep the Magister bound, so that Piercing Shot can be used freely as a 188% ability, allowing you to push bleeds. \u2b25 Shadow Tendrils should be used outside of Death's Swiftness due to the 25% corruption damage bonus, as the damage is sufficiently high. \u2b25 If you have an Eldritch Crossbow , you can use its special attack in combination with Shadow Tendrils followed by Rapid Fire and Snap Shot while Death's Swiftness is on cooldown. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Hydrix bolts can be used to cover the adrenaline cost to have 100% in time for Death's Swiftness and these will likely proc within this time frame. Onyx bolts can alternatively provide healing if needed.

Stand Still The Magister will yell \"Stand still!\" and stun the player for 4.2s, dealing ~2300 melee damage before dashing away in a random direction. It's possible for this combo damage to be very high as he will immediately do a mage attack after escaping, if you do get hit, use Freedom and pray Deflect Magic . This is avoided by simply not standing in melee range of the boss, but if the player is using melee, they should use a halberd at 2 tile range at lower skill levels. Another method is to step away from Magister when he may do a special attack, his ability to do rapid consecutive actions can make this difficult and therefore requires high skill and insight to do well. This mechanic replaces the \"Barge\" mechanic while the player is in melee distance. This mechanic is instant and thus cannot be reacted to proactively, this makes resonance not an option.

Using this to your advantage can help reduce damage lost to phase caps. \u2b25 Magister's phasing is \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udca6 based \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\ude32 on \ud83d\udc8b\ud83c\udffc him \ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\udc8f attempting to auto attack \ud83e\udd3c\u2694 or taking \ud83d\udc85 a \ud83c\udf6c hit \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc4a of \ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd24 damage \u2604 within \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude31 attack range (which \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f is \ud83d\udc4c instead mitigated), as \ud83c\udfff such, if \ud83c\udfc3 you are \u2753 outside of \ud83c\udf39\ud83d\udca6 his \ud83d\udc68 attack \ud83e\udd3c\ud83e\udd3c range, \ud83e\udd24 he \ud83d\udc68\ud83e\udd34 will \ud83d\udc44\u26bd not \u2642 phase. \ud83c\udf12 This \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc40 only really applies to \ud83d\udca6 the SGB and \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4f Noxious longbow at \u2757 9 tiles when \ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf51 he is \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udffc bound. \ud83e\udd10 This \u261d also \u2795 has the \ud83d\udcd6 implication that \ud83d\ude10 he sometimes \ud83d\ude0f will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd14 phase \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\udcb0 few \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udc47 ticks after reaching his HP threshold instead of instantly \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf which \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\udc4f is \ud83d\udc49 something \ud83d\udc4b to \ud83d\udca6 be aware \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c of.

Alternatively, use a scythe and stand outside of \ud83d\udc19 melee distance. Kills \u2b25 Every other kill, Berserk + Adren Pot and do your berserk rotation, make use of Greater Barge if you can. Your aim is mostly to burst past phases so he doesn't get the chance to attempt a special attack. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Then every other kill start the kill with a ZGS spec , if you are at 87%+ adrenaline at the start of the kill you may be able to make use of Greater Barge , however don't force the adrenaline at the end of the previous kill as forcing it won't be worth the 1.8s saved by the bleed. \u2b25 Threshold order: Destroy (or Hurricane ) first, Assault second (and Greater Flurry , if applicable, last) so that you can use destroy twice per kill without messing up your next kill's destroy cooldown, unlike if you tried to assault twice in a single kill then instantly in the next. \u2b25 Finish the kills with Slaughter and Blood Tendrils , as they do not benefit from being used inside ZGS/zerk and your other strong threshold abilities will be on CD. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If your dreadnip stuns the magister when you slaughter, use Kick or Stomp to walk the bleed instead. \u2b25 In melee's case, the rotation is slightly more resilient, you will find yourself following this pattern on most, if not all, kills. However, if your DPS happens to be particularly good, you may find your adrenaline potion or limitless coming off cooldown ever so slightly too slow. For much of this, you can simply delay your zerk and use Greater Flurry /Destroy (depending on how long left you have on apot) then build back to Berserk . \u2b25 If you believe you'll fail to burst past a phase with Destroy for example, you can interrupt on the 3rd hit with Punish and run outside of melee distance on the same tick. Magister can attack before you get your 4th hit off, which also means he can spec and stun you out of your 4th hit as well as waste your time getting back to him, damaging you in the process. This is especially bad if you are in a ZGS spec and he dashes away from the area. However, you can keep channeling your through hits 3 and 4 even if you know a special attack is coming if you believe the 3rd hit will initiate the next phase, thus reseting his action counter back to 3 remaining attacks and removing the possibility of being stunned.

This helps in going over Magister's hard cap every 50k lp. \u2b25 Use Punish as a free 188 ability whenever he's stunned/rooted from dreadnips. \u2b25 Walk Slaughter by quickly stepping under him, if he's stunned use Kick .

Raksha will continously absorb \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35 the \ud83c\udffb shadow \ud83d\udc64 anima pools, shown below \ud83d\ude2b Raksha's HP bar. \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b The \ud83d\ude02 shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 absorption increases the \u264b\ud83d\udc4c damage Raksha deals to \u27a1\ud83d\udca6 the player and \ud83c\udf7c reduces the \ud83c\udffd damage \u2620\u2620 it \ud83d\udc10 takes \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c from the \ud83d\udc4f player. \ud83d\udcb0 The \u2b50\ud83d\udcb2 player \ud83e\udd37 will \ud83d\udc4a need \ud83d\udd75\ud83d\udc49 to kill these \ud83d\ude91\ud83d\udc46 shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 anima pools in \ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\udc49 order to \ud83d\udc69 prevent \ud83d\udeab Raksha from \ud83d\ude02\ud83c\udd71 absorbing them. Raksha's Rotation Raksha's whole \ud83d\udc50 attack \ud83e\udd3c rotation throughout the \ud83d\udc4f fight \u2642\ud83d\udca5 can \ud83d\udcaf be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc4f summarised in \ud83c\udf24\ud83d\udc44 the \ud83d\udca1 image \ud83d\udcf8 below. Image \ud83d\uddbc\ud83d\udcf8 courtesy of \ud83d\ude34\ud83e\udd14 #Brad \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 Special \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\ude02 Attack \u2694\u2694 Information \ud83d\udcda Tail Swipe Raksha will do a Tail Swipe special attack if the player is in Raksha's melee distance. Raksha does a spin animation and hits a 3 square radius around it. Players will get stunned and hit around 6,000 to 8,000 damage. In order to avoid this special attack, move 2 squares back from scythe distance. Alternatively you can Escape or Bladed Dive . Raksha also spawns 3 anima blobs at 0% shadow absorption when he does this special attack. Getting hit by this causes , which disables protection prayers. Charge Raksha will do a Charge special attack if the player is not in melee distance. Raksha charges towards the player, stunning them and hitting around 6,000 to 8,000 damage. In order to avoid this special attack, players will need to move sideways. Raksha also spawns 3 anima blobs at 0% shadow absorption when he does this special attack. Getting hit by this causes , which disables protection prayers. Shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 Bomb \ud83d\udca6 The Shadow Bomb will stun a player and a Shadow Bomb will fall from the sky, marked by a target on the ground. If the Shadow Bomb hits the player, they are inflicted with the debuff, preventing them from using protection prayers and deflection curses. This special attack can be avoided by using either Anticipate or Freedom prior and moving 2 tiles out of the shadow bomb's target area. Mind Poison \ud83e\udd12\ud83e\udd12 Raksha spawns 2 \ud83c\udf73 - 4 shadow \ud83d\udc64 orbs near the \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc89 player, each dealing \ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udeac 600 damage every few ticks until \ud83d\udca6 expelled by clicking. If \ud83c\udf46\u2049 not \ud83d\ude45 expelled, they \ud83d\udcaa explode for 2,000 - 3,000 \ud83e\udd5c damage \u2620 each. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f 5X Shockwave The 5X shockwave consists of 5 mage hits on the player. When Raksha uses the Shockwave special attack he will gain enrage from all the currently alive shadow anima blobs. Players can use + Devotion to mitigate the damage from this special attack. Erebus Charge A blue \ud83d\udc41 dome surrounds Raksha while he stops \u274c\u274c attacking \u2642\ud83e\udd3c and \ud83d\udc4f an \ud83d\udc79 extra action button appears on \ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udcaf the \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\udca5 screen. Players \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcf1 will \u26bd\u2753 need to \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udc68 deal a \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\udd2c minimum of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcf0 10,000 damage to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 break \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\ude47 the dome. As \ud83d\udc44 the dome explodes, fragments of \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udffb shadow anima will \ud83d\udc4f be \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc1d scattered throughout the \u261d\ud83d\ude29 arena. The \ud83d\udc7a total \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcaf damage \u2620 needed \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 break \ud83c\udf77 the \ud83d\udcac dome depends on \ud83d\udd1b how much \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaf shadow anima was \ud83d\udc4f absorbed \ud83d\ude35 in phase 1 - 3. \ud83e\udd14\ud83c\udffc If \ud83e\udd37 the player \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udfae does \u270a not \ud83d\ude45\u2600 destroy \ud83d\ude9c\ud83c\udf46 the dome, they \ud83d\ude4b\ud83d\udc67 can \ud83d\udcaf hide behind \u21a9\ud83c\udf51 the \u203c pillars instead. After \ud83d\udd51\ud83d\ude21 the \ud83d\udca6 dome has \ud83d\udeb8 been \ud83d\udcab destroyed, \ud83c\udfda\ud83c\udfda players can pick \u26cf up the \ud83d\udcb0 shadow anima scattered throughout the \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\udea7 arena and \ud83d\udcb0 click \ud83d\uddb1\ud83d\uddb1 the \ud83d\udc06\ud83d\udcac action button to \ud83d\udca6 gain \ud83d\udd11 10% extra \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\udde3 damage per \ud83d\udc7c\ud83d\udc7c shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 anima collected. Shadow Manifestation Minions \ud83d\ude2d\u2753 Raksha will \ud83d\ude4f spawn a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4f 10,000 \ud83d\udcaf HP minion \ud83d\udca9\ud83c\udf4c for \ud83d\udc4a each \ud83d\udc4f player. \ud83d\udcb0 Shadow Manifestations will hit players \ud83d\udcf1 with \ud83d\ude05\u27a1 a melee attack and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udd2b if \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udcaf left for too long, will \ud83d\udc4f perform \ud83c\udfad a \ud83d\udc36 frenzy special attack, rapidly \ud83d\udca8 hitting \ud83d\ude26\ud83d\ude26 players \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udcb0 with \ud83d\ude23\ud83d\udc4f melee hits and \ud83d\udc4f applying an \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udcb8 armour break \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\ude32 of 1% \ud83c\udf05 per \ud83d\udc7c stack. \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udcda Rockfall Rockfall occurs as \ud83d\udcb0 a \ud83d\udca9 transition special \ud83d\udc4b attack between \u2194\ud83d\udc49 phases 1-3. \u2642 During the rockfall, 5x5 rocks \ud83d\udc95 will \ud83d\udcb0 spawn every \ud83d\udc4f tick, prioritising the \ud83d\ude0e current \ud83e\udd15\ud83e\udd15 player \ud83d\ude24 location. \u2714 However, if \ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udcb2 there \ud83d\udc4c already is \ud83c\udffb a \ud83d\udc4c\u27a1 rock \ud83d\udebc above \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udd1d the \ud83c\udfe0\u2696 player, \u2640\ud83d\udc68 it \ud83d\udc49 will spawn in \ud83d\udc4f a random \ud83c\udfb2\ud83c\udfb2 area in the \ud83d\udc66 arena. When Raksha uses \ud83c\udd92\ud83c\udd92 the \ud83d\udc57\ud83c\udff3 rockfall special, \ud83c\udf81\ud83d\udcaf 8 anima blobs \ud83d\ude21 spawn in \ud83c\udf0b the arena. More \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udca6 than 8 \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udc4a anima blobs \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 will spawn in \ud83d\udd25 the arena if \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udcaf the \ud83c\udf44 shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 absorption \ud83d\ude35 rate \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udcc9 is \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude02 more \ud83d\ude2d\u26a0 than \u2640\ud83d\udc89 0%. \u274c Shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 Anima Pools \u2642\u2642 During \ud83d\udea3\ud83c\udfc3 the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udd7e fight \ud83d\udc4a\ud83e\udd1c Raksha will \ud83d\udcce spawn Shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 anima pools \ud83c\udfca\ud83c\udfca (commonly referred to anima pools/blobs/piles.) after the spin/charge special \ud83d\udc85 and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f the \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\ude97 rockfall special. \u2708 Raksha will \ud83d\udd95 absorb \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35 from \ud83d\ude32\ud83d\udc49 these when \ud83d\udd54 he \ud83e\udd8a uses \ud83c\udd92\ud83c\udd92 the Shockwave special \ud83d\udc7e\ud83d\udc4b attack, or \ud83d\udea8\ud83c\udfa1 if they \ud83d\udc8f\u2642 are \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\ude45 left \ud83d\udc48 alive too \ud83d\ude14 long in \u23f3\ud83d\udd2b phase 3. Each \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f anima pool \ud83c\udf0a has \u2753\ud83d\udc4f 1000 health \u26d1 and \ud83c\udf40\ud83d\udc4f they \ud83d\udc65\ud83d\ude04 spawn in 4 \ud83d\udca6 different \ud83d\udcac\ud83d\ude44 areas in \ud83d\udd3d the \u2705 arena. These \ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udfff must be \ud83d\udc1d dealt with \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude02 right before \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udca6 the \ud83c\udd71 Shockwave attack \u2694\u2694 or \ud83d\ude8b\ud83d\udca6 phase 3. \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd00 Note: If not dealt with Raksha will gain enrage which gives Raksha healing, damage increase, damage reduction and the Shield on Phase 4 will require more damage to break. Shadow Anima On \u27a1\ud83d\udeb6 Phase \ud83c\udf11\ud83c\udf14 4 Raksha will \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe do \ud83c\udfc6 the \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\udc48 Erebus Charge attack. \u2694 During this attack \u2694 Raksha will \ud83d\udc4b be shielded and dealing damage \u2604 to \u2642 the \ud83c\udf42 shield \u2697 drops anima around \ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd27 the \ud83d\udc69 arena, destroying the \ud83d\udcb0 shield will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f spawn a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcb0 lot \ud83e\udd23 of \ud83d\udca6 anima compared to \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udca9 damaging the shield. \ud83d\udca6 Anima can \u2757 be \ud83c\udff3 collected by running into \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude9f the pickup \u23eb\u23eb range \ud83d\udca6 (5x5).

Advanced \u269b Ranged Strategy for \ud83d\ude0f Solo This is an advanced rotation assuming you own most of the high level gear (including new gear like fleeting boots), and will not help achieve a first kill. The goal kill times are 2:25-2:40. Kill times vary a lot due to the RNG of ranged with bolt procs. This rotation doesn't use Ecb EoF. This guide assumes you follow the exact bolt switches mentioned until a bolt is mentioned again. Improvising Bolt switches around bolt procs is assumed. Using If are on cd is assumed.

Introduction RotS is \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udfa4 generally \ud83d\ude04 done \ud83c\udfff in \ud83d\udd2b a \ud83d\udca6\u23f0 team \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udfc3 size of \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udca6 4 \ud83c\udff3 and \ud83c\udfff\ud83c\udffb the fight \ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd1c takes place \ud83d\ude02 in a split \ud83d\udebb arena where \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udf35 the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc9c team \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udc12 is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 split into pairs. Each side \u2640 will \ud83c\udffc have \ud83c\ude36\ud83c\udf81 3 brothers, the order \ud83e\udd1c of \ud83d\udca6 which \ud83d\ude4c\ud83e\udd24 changes everyday. \ud83e\udd14 However \ud83d\udd90\ud83e\udd14 you \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68 will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf33 spend \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb8 more \ud83d\ude22\u2714 time \ud83d\udd52 running \ud83c\udfc3 through tunnels than you will \ud83d\udc4f actually fighting the brothers, which \ud83d\udc31 is \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udd64 why \u2753\u2753 it \ud83d\udcaa is \ud83c\udd71 important to be \ud83d\udc4f proficient at \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udc78 both \ud83c\udf1c\ud83d\udc69 dps rotations and \ud83d\udc8f\ud83d\ude45 movement abilties i.e. \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd14 surge + bladed dive. This \ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udd71 is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udd70 also \u2795 why \ud83d\ude21 having \ud83d\ude38\ud83d\udc49 the mobile \ud83d\udcf1 perk, \u23eb\u23eb double surge and \ud83c\udf52 bladed dive unlocked \ud83d\udd13\ud83d\udd13 is \ud83d\ude1d crucial for \u262f\ud83c\udf81 high \u2b06\u23eb kph. At \ud83d\udca6 RotS the \ud83c\udf46 meta is \u2049 to AoE the brothers \ud83d\udc6c\ud83d\udc6c down \ud83d\ude29\u2b07 as fast \ud83d\udea6 as \ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udfa3 possible. Most \ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udc49 of \ud83d\udc4a the \ud83d\udcf2 meta and \ud83d\udc4f strategy revolve around stacking and luring the \u2695 brothers \ud83d\udc6c so that \u274c\ud83d\ude10 they \u2049\ud83d\udc74 can \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b be killed \u274c\u2620 at \ud83d\ude02\u2642 the \ud83d\ude4f same \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude02 time. By far \ud83c\udd98 the best \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc78 way \u2195\ud83d\udcab to \u2642\u270c do \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udfc3 this \ud83c\udf85\ud83d\ude29 is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca9 have everyone use \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe mechanised chinchompas and range, \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 melee can be \ud83d\udc1d used \ud83d\ude9f\ud83d\udc68 but \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude1c you \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc48 will be \u27a1 fine with \ud83d\udc4f range assuming \ud83e\udd14 you have \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude1c a Dark bow \ud83c\udff9 Essence of Finality. Chinchompas make \ud83d\ude4b\ud83d\udcb0 almost \ud83d\udca6\u25c0 all \ud83c\udf3c\ud83d\ude02 abilities AoE. In general, \ud83d\udc6e all \ud83e\udd35 three brothers \ud83d\udc6c on \ud83e\udd3a a \ud83c\udd71 side \u23e9\u23e9 are stacked on top \ud83d\udd3c\ud83d\udd3c of \ud83d\ude8b\ud83d\ude8b each \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f other and then \ud83d\udd50 taking \ud83d\udc85 advantage of chins AoE to \ud83d\ude18 kill \u2620 them \ud83d\udc79 all. \ud83d\ude19\ud83d\udcaf Well-executed, \ud83e\udd14 this strategy should result in consistent 15-20s \ud83d\udcec\ud83d\udcec kills \u2620\ud83d\ude35 on \ud83c\udfb6 any \ud83d\udeb8\ud83d\udd25 rotation. Additionally, \u270f\u2795 because the ability \ud83d\udc49 rotation is \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udca6 independent \ud83d\ude45 of the \ud83c\udf46\u261d organization of \ud83d\udc68 the brothers, \ud83d\udc6c\ud83d\udc6c it is very \ud83d\udc81 consistent and \u2b06\ud83d\udcb0 easy \u2753 to \ud83d\udc4f learn \ud83d\udcda and \ud83d\udc4e perfect. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c Presets Bladed dive is \ud83d\ude10\u2753 critical to being \ud83d\ude46\ud83e\udd17 able \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udd35 exit tunnels efficiently and \ud83d\udd1f\ud83d\udc4e increase KPH. One important thing \ud83e\udd17\ud83d\udcf4 for \ud83d\udcb0 RotS is \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude29 to \ud83d\udca6\u2702 use \ud83d\udc4f the Undead Slayer perk, as it \ud83d\udcdd will \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc3c increase \ud83d\udcb3\ud83d\udcb3 your DPS by \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08 a flat 7%. \u23f0\ud83d\udd25 Undead Slayer \ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46 ability, \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 if owned and \ud83d\udc4f activated, will \ud83d\udc51\ud83e\udd14 also increase \ud83d\udcb3\ud83d\udcb3 your \ud83c\udffc damage against the brothers \ud83d\udc6c\ud83d\udc6c by \ud83c\udf44 15% \ud83d\udc69 for \u262f 10 \ud83d\udd1f seconds. \ud83d\ude2b Trips are \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc74 generally \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 ~30 minutes long, it \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udcaf is rare to \ud83c\udd94\ud83d\udca6 eat \ud83c\udf58 during kills \ud83d\udc80\u203c and the \ud83c\udf85 majority of your food will be used \ud83c\udd92\ud83c\udd92 while \u2640\ud83c\udffb in \ud83d\udc4f tunnels.

Dharok is next \ud83c\udf28\ud83d\udcc5 because \u2721\u261d he hits \ud83c\udfaf hard when \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udd50 low \u2b07\u2b07 HP and \ud83d\udcb0 can \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd2b prolong a kill \ud83d\ude43 if he \ud83d\udc68 does \ud83d\udc4f\u2753 a \ud83c\udfed Give \ud83d\ude45 Me \ud83c\udfeb Everything \ud83d\ude4c special. Guthan is slightly less \u2796\ud83d\udc4e annoying \ud83d\ude11 than \ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udd3a Dharok.

There are much better ways to use your adrenaline, but this is a safe method. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Tank it. \ud83d\udd25 You will \u26bd\ud83d\udcaf take \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udecd maximum ~8k with zerk aura, reduced depending on \ud83c\udfff proximity to \ud83d\udc6e your \u261d partner. Note: The melee hit will hit before the bomb damage, so don\u2019t accidentally resonance / disrupt the melee hit. Depending on how far away you are from Solak, the bomb will hit before the range attack. \u2b25 After your zerk runs out, use zgs spec and continue dpsing until 2.25 million hp. \u2b25 After the base's bleeds run out the dpser will voke and use their own bleeds allowing both to use bleeds and flanking. \u2b25 Sunshine west of the circle in the middle of the arena then move on to the roots starting at the northernmost one on your side. Note: For no zgs rotation, after your zerk you want to lure Solak to the northeast/northwest roots depending where you placed your mines pre-fight. After luring Solak to the roots the base will sun on 2nd northern-most root and the Dpser will sun on the root north of the base. \u2b25 Place \ud83c\udfe1 your extra \ud83d\udde3 two \u270c\u270c mines at 2 \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude29 different roots, \ud83d\uded0 after Solak is \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\udd5b capped. \u2b25 Any \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude3b roots \ud83d\ude07 left \u2b05 alive \ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47 will turn \ud83e\udd14 into \u27a1 Blightbound Lashers.

You'll all of your health back on arms and legs. \u2b25 If you are camping mage and Solak is still relatively high hp, sun as late into legs as possible to have your sun carry through after core to help get root skip. \u2b25 If both are hybriding, one person offs early on legs and the kills the last leg to get a better berserk making 1cycle likely. \u2b25 When the legs are low hp, zerk + barge to finish the leg and get the gbarge effect. \u2b25 Finish the core \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 then run \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udfc3 south \ud83d\udc47 for \ud83d\udcc0 the next \u23e9 phase.

Be wary of a range auto sniping your res . \u2b25 Freedom so you will not be dragged out of sun when Solak begins his binding attack. \u2b25 Base will run up Solak\u2019s arm to deal a vicious blow.

Both players should then use Berserk and proceed to do the following rotations: Base: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( ) bleed with dual-wield \u2192 (off-hand+2H auto) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( to pad) \u2192 (stall if necessary) ( back to Solak) \u2192 (release stalled by clicking Solak if necessary) \u2192 DPS: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( ) bleed \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 flanking \u2192 (stall if necessary) ( back to Solak) \u2192 (release stalled by clicking Solak if necessary) \u2192 == End \u26d4\ud83c\udffc of zerk == Base: ( ) \u2192 + walk \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( ) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 flanking \u2192 \u2192 (mage switch) + \u2192 \u2192 DPS: \u2192 (DW) \u2192 (off-hand+2H auto) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 flanking ( here) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( ) + walk \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (dw) \u2192 (mage switch) \u2192 \u2192 Only 1 \ud83d\udc48 DPS should \ud83e\udd14 bleed \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 after \u23f3 ZGS spec in \ud83d\ude0d 4 man. \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude02 Note that it is generally a good idea to walk Solak south at the beginning of the fight until he is roughly in the centre of the arena - this makes it so that pads are easier to to and from. P1 roots: \ud83d\uded0\ud83d\udcda Properly handling roots is crucial to an efficient P1. Without prior communication or assumptions about strategy, it can be easy to overkill or waste mines on roots. Below are diagrams for the roots that should be mined and attacked by each person. Remember that roots can be bound and flanked. As a rule of thumb, any roots NOT in sunshine range should be meleed , to take advantage of TMW dismember + tendrils , as well as stronger basics. Note \ud83c\udfb5 that roots \u271d\ud83d\uded0 should \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc98 only be \ud83d\udca8 targeted after \ud83d\ude0f Solak has \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f been \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\udd0e phased to \ud83c\ude36 2.25m \ud83d\ude29 ( 3.75m in 4 man). If he \u2642 is \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc49 above the HP cap, he \ud83d\udc49\u2642 will do \ud83d\udc49 the \ud83d\udcd6 roots \ud83d\uded0 spec (marked tile with \ud83d\ude45\ud83d\ude45 timer) at 1:06 \ud83d\udcac on \ud83d\udd1b\ud83d\udd1b the \ud83d\udc4f boss \ud83d\udcbc timer. If \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd14 the cap has \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd14 been \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude00 hit, he \ud83e\udd8a\ud83d\udc68 will \ud83c\udfff phase into \ud83d\ude9f\ud83d\ude9f arms/legs. Duo After sunning, the base should mine the southernmost root on the west side. or back to your , and kill the two roots shown below in your . The DPS should mine the northernmost root on the east side, and kill the two roots shown below. If the abilities shown below do not kill roots completely, it\u2019s fine to ignore them unless they are very high health (5k+), or if the previous root (the next anticlockwise root) is alive also, since roots heal in a clockwise pattern. 4-Man In 4 man, there are more specific root roles.

The \ud83d\udc4f two elf 1 \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udf38 roles should \ud83d\udc98 kill \u274e\ud83d\udd2a and \u2795 go up \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\ude02 the \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc4f same \ud83d\udc6d erupt, while \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udd51 the \ud83d\ude91 base and \ud83d\udc4f elf 2 \ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\udecb kill the \u2934 other \ud83c\udf3e\ud83d\ude4c and stay down. \ud83d\ude83 The elf 1\u2019s \u274c\u270b should \ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc98 sigil zerk, sun, and use \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4f thresholds until phased, while \ud83d\udd57\u2640 the base \ud83d\udc7a and elf 2 sigil zerk, sun, \ud83d\udd25 and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf46 ZGS depending on \ud83d\udd1b\ud83d\udc4f HP.

Southern eruptions (all \ud83d\udcaf sizes) All players should start on the SE erupt and use , + \u2192 \u2192 flanking on it. Right after , the cleanse should be activated and players should or to the SW erupt. Use \u2192 \u2192 on it, or 3t if you missed ticks travelling between eruptions. Right after , run back to the middle to get cleansed, using a on Solak while doing so. You should be cleansed after sharding, so or to the SW circle to go up to the storm. Note that you will have to be tick perfect if using 5t , so just do 3t until you are comfortable with the cleanse timing. Also remember that the Inquisitor\u2019s staff effect does not work on eruptions, so and should be done with dual wield. Northern \ud83c\udf85 eruptions If \ud83d\udd0e\ud83d\udc69 all \u2728\ud83d\ude2b players \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udfae are using \ud83d\udce4\ud83d\udce4 the proper abilities on \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udd1b the \ud83d\udc4f\u2b50 southern eruptions, they \ud83d\udc65\ud83d\ude1d will \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc8d always die \ud83d\udc80 before \ud83d\ude02\u23ea the \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f cleanse. \ud83d\udec1 After \ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udd71 coming \ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udfc3 down \u2b07\u2b07 from \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udca6 the \ud83d\ude4f storm, \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf00 the \ud83d\udc64\ud83c\udf1f team should \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc98 evenly split \ud83d\udebb\ud83d\udebb damage between \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc49 the two \ud83d\udc8f northern \ud83c\udf85 erupts. Also \u2795 remember to \ud83d\ude45 switch \ud83c\udf9a\ud83c\udf9a to melee for \ud83d\udd04 the northern \ud83c\udf85 erupts. Duo: Players can either decide pre-fight or while killing the storm which eruption they will go to. Before targeting an eruption, check to make sure both southern eruptions are dead. If not, the player who has chosen the side with the surviving southern eruption should it and use good basics to kill it, then bleed on the northern eruption on the same side. The DPS should go up a second time to kill the storm, while the base stays down. 4-Man Same \ud83d\udca9 as \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc91 duo, except \ud83d\ude2e the \ud83d\ude9f\ud83d\ude0f elf 1\u2019s go up twice to \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\udca6 kill the \ud83d\udc4f storm and \ud83d\udd1b the base \ud83d\ude22 and elf \ud83d\udc07\ud83d\udc07 2 stay \ud83d\udc69 down. \u2b07\ud83d\udd0a All \ud83d\udc68 sizes: All players should use \u2192 \u2192 bled \u2192 flanking \u2192 \u2192 188s to finish on the erupts. After \u23f3\ud83d\ude21 eruptions are \ud83d\udcaf dead, \ud83d\udc7b the storm \ud83c\udf00 should \ud83d\udc98 hit \ud83d\udc4a a \ud83d\udc4f few \ud83d\udd1b times before \ud83d\ude25 dying \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude02 as \ud83d\udc91\ud83c\udfff well. \ud83d\ude28 Ults for \ud83c\udf85\ud83d\udc49 P2 work a bit differently between \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc48 duo and \ud83d\udc4f 4 man, and also \u2795\u2795 vary based on \ud83d\udcb0 aggro. Duo: If Solak is on the DPS, the base should and use flanking before Solak reaggros. Within this sun you should aim to get 2x , 1x and 1x . Note that you should freely use all bleeds here, as the DPS will be zerking after coming down from the storm. After the second build to 100 adren, and do the same rotation as P1 (bled + ). Your should be over before the start of rain spec. After , use all TMW bleeds ( + ), then . Optimally, this should be happening just a few abilities before the arms spec, so you should be able to and \u2192 (remember to out of MD to prevent auto) . Regardless, use + and 188s in ZGS to bring Solak to the phase HP. Make sure your adren is high at this time, to be able to + ASAP at the start of P3. If Solak is on you, use TMW bleeds ( + ) first, then build to zerk. Sun afterwards with the same thresholds mentioned before, then ZGS. The DPS should zerk when they come down from the storm, doing the same rotation as P1 (bled \u200e \u200e + ). Afterwards, do a sun rotation similar to the base, aiming to get 2x , 1x and 1x flanking . when you are around 80 adren after the second . Due to the fact that the DPS goes up twice, you have less time for P2, which generally means it\u2019s better to without barging, and for arms. Your rotation here can vary a bit, though, so just use your own judgement and above all make sure you are giving yourself enough time to to + climb the arm. Whilst climbing, you will not be able to melee Solak, so switch to mage and build until he phases. If the HP is quite high at this point, you can use thresholds. Note that you should try to avoid using mage autos around when Solak phases here, as you will end up stalling any autos you use during the phase transition (this forces your next auto to be a mage auto regardless of weapon type, so you will be unable to 5taa in your P3 ). 4-Man: \ud83d\udca6 P2 damage is a bit more important in 4 man kills, since you are not timegated by the arm spec. If Solak is aggro\u2019d on either of the elf 1\u2019s, the base and elf 2 should use mage thresholds and the base should + ( ) \u2192 before building to (mage thresholds can be skipped if low on adrenaline). The base and elf 1 should with mobile (use either Excalibur or mage armor) on their erupt so that it is back for . If Solak is aggro\u2019d on base or elf 1, the base can instantly + , then build to . The elf 1\u2019s essentially do the exact same rotation as the DPS in a duo, except the ZGS at the end of the phase should be skipped. Sigil + (same rotation as P1) and . The base should make sure to always apply ( ) + between ults. On a good kill this means that generally the base (and often the elf 2 as well) will not have enough time to get a good ZGS off, if this is the case, simply continue using thresholds in and / afterwards (the base should, again, use TMW bleeds). Phase \ud83c\udf11 3 \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udca6 Summary: Regardless \ud83e\udd37 of team size/role, P3 always \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udd54 starts \ud83d\udd79 off the same \ud83e\udd22\ud83d\ude2f - all \ud83d\ude0d\u2764 players \ud83d\udcb0 zerk+apot, bleed \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udc89 either \ud83d\ude19\ud83d\ude17 assault or \ud83c\udd71 destroy, \ud83d\udca3 then fully \ud83c\udf93\ud83d\ude15 channel \ud83d\udc40\ud83e\udd21 the other \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udd79 ability. \ud83d\udc49 In duo, the first \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd47 pad \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d is ignored and both \ud83d\udc6c\ud83c\udf1c players \ud83c\udfae should \ud83d\ude15 sun \ud83d\udd25\u2600 after \u23f3 zerk. The \ud83c\udd71 base \ud83d\udc7a should lure around \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb0 580k with \ud83d\udc4f slaughter. Go \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udfc3 in \ud83d\udc4f elf at no higher \u2705 than \ud83c\udd70\ud83d\udc89 350k and \ud83d\udc4f ZGS spec, with \ud83d\ude09 one player \ud83e\udd37 using \ud83d\udce4\ud83e\udd33 both \ud83c\udf46 TMW bleeds (blood \ud83d\udc40 tendrils + dismember). In 4 \ud83d\ude02 man, the elf \ud83d\udc07\ud83d\udc07 1\u2019s \u2b07\ud83d\udc77 go \ud83c\udfc3\u2642 in \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udeaa the first \ud83d\udc46 pad and \u2640 ZGS spec, and the base \ud83d\ude35 and \ud83d\ude1e elf \ud83d\udc07 2 \ud83d\ude48\ud83c\udfff proceed \ud83d\udeb6 outside \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\udd25 as \ud83d\udc91 if in \ud83d\udc44\ud83d\ude0e a \ud83d\ude20\ud83c\udd70 duo, with the \ud83d\udc4f base \ud83d\ude44 luring at \ud83d\udc4c 1.1m and \ud83d\ude4c going \ud83c\udfc3 in the \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udfe1 2nd pad at no \ud83c\udf46 higher than \ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd22 750k. During the phase transition to P4, if already not at 100 adrenaline, there is time to use 2 defensives and . All players + \u2192 , and bleed assault and channel destroy (or vice versa). Remember to 5taa to not lose any ticks of here. The DPS(s) can use and flanking and the base can use to fill out their respective zerk rotations. Near the beginning of the phase, the base should also position Solak such that he is south of the northernmost pad. This is to make it easier for the base to flank in , which can be done when Solak does his seizure animation while charging pads. Solak should begin to seize after the first ability out of . Duo In duo the first pad is ignored. The base should ( ) , then . The DPS should sun on the northern wall to easily flank and also avoid Solak\u2019s stun. The base should in at some point and lure Solak to the 2nd pad at around 580k HP (can be lower if uncomfortable). Both players enter the elf when the HP is at most 350k (you can also just decide with your duo partner what kind of P4 HP you are both comfortable with), and proceed to barge + ZGS. Both players will bleed and flank at some point depending on when the other player . One player should use ( ) , , and , while the other should use and . Note that Erethdor is capable of using on , so it should not be used. 4-Man: The elf 1\u2019s should use after their s, then use defensives and enter the elf. The rotations used in the elf should be more adren conservative as both elf 1\u2019s will need to sun immediately when they come out. Something similar to bleed \u2192 OR bleed \u2192 + \u2192 is fine. After elf, the elf 1\u2019s should in the same spots as in a duo - one southwest, but east of the base (so as to not hit the base with roots), and one on the northern wall. The base and elf 2 do essentially the exact same rotations as in a duo, except Solak can be lured to the pad much earlier (1.1m is generally safe to start charging). Phase \ud83c\udf13 4 Summary: Remember \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 to \u2642\ud83d\ude18 shard while Solak is \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udca5 immune to \ud83d\ude93 damage (but \ud83d\udd2e\ud83d\ude07 attackable). The \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udc4f timing for zerking P4 is \ud83d\ude02 5 \ud83d\ude02 abilities + 2t, then \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udd5b zerk. Provided nobody \u274c\ud83e\udd10 on \u2b07 the \ud83d\udc4f team \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 has died, \ud83d\ude02 sigil zerk with \ud83c\udd95 a bled assault, hurricane, and \ud83d\udc4c flurry (or shatter and destroy) \ud83d\ude31 from \ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\ude2e all \u27a1\ud83d\udc4c players \ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udcf1 will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude1b easily \ud83d\ude0a finish \ud83c\udfeb\ud83c\udfeb off \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udca6 Solak. In duo and 4 man the rotations are exactly the same. If you are able to build to 100 adrenaline before Solak is attackable, Natural Instinct can be used. To build back to 100 adrenaline in time, use (with 2H auto) \u2192 \u2192 5TAA + basic \u2192 basic ( if base) \u2192 defensive \u2192 . With active during P4, you will be able to use a instead of your 3rd threshold, so something like \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 bleed \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 / depending on HP ( beforehand if base). If Solak\u2019s starting HP is high in this phase, you can stall ( if base) in the middle of your zerk and release the tick before ( / if base). This will make it so that Solak\u2019s HP is higher for longer, which makes manifestations spawn slower (manifestations in the mind spawn faster as Solak\u2019s corporeal HP decreases). Remember to cast , turn on the Wrath prayer, call + manually target your Ripper Demon on Solak (as killing elf often causes Ripper to lose its target), and deploy Dreadnips if bringing them. With all these safeguards, it should be relatively easy to finish off Solak without dying on starting health pools of up to 350k in duo or 570k in 4 man.

Before starting, the base should use an ability such as Reprisal or Devotion to signal to the DPS that they are about to engage Solak. Both players should then use Berserk and proceed to do the following rotations: Base: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( ) bleed with dual-wield \u2192 (off-hand+2H auto) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( to pad) \u2192 (stall if necessary) ( back to Solak) \u2192 (release stalled by clicking Solak if necessary) \u2192 DPS: \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( ) bleed \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 flanking \u2192 (stall if necessary) ( back to Solak) \u2192 (release stalled by clicking Solak if necessary) \u2192 == End \u26d4\ud83c\udffc of zerk == Base: ( ) \u2192 + walk \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( ) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 flanking \u2192 \u2192 (mage switch) + \u2192 \u2192 DPS: \u2192 (DW) \u2192 (off-hand+2H auto) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 flanking ( here) \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 ( ) + walk \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 (dw) \u2192 (mage switch) \u2192 \u2192 Only 1 \ud83d\udc48 DPS should \ud83e\udd14 bleed \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 after \u23f3 ZGS spec in \ud83d\ude0d 4 man. \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude02 Note that it is generally a good idea to walk Solak south at the beginning of the fight until he is roughly in the centre of the arena - this makes it so that pads are easier to to and from. P1 roots: \ud83d\uded0\ud83d\udcda Properly handling roots is crucial to an efficient P1. Without prior communication or assumptions about strategy, it can be easy to overkill or waste mines on roots. Below are diagrams for the roots that should be mined and attacked by each person. Remember that roots can be bound and flanked. As a rule of thumb, any roots NOT in sunshine range should be meleed , to take advantage of TMW dismember + tendrils , as well as stronger basics. Note \ud83c\udfb5 that roots \u271d\ud83d\uded0 should \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc98 only be \ud83d\udca8 targeted after \ud83d\ude0f Solak has \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f been \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\udd0e phased to \ud83c\ude36 2.25m \ud83d\ude29 ( 3.75m in 4 man).

If \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd14 the cap has \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd14 been \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude00 hit, he \ud83e\udd8a\ud83d\udc68 will \ud83c\udfff phase into \ud83d\ude9f\ud83d\ude9f arms/legs. Duo After sunning, the base should mine the southernmost root on the west side. or back to your , and kill the two roots shown below in your . The DPS should mine the northernmost root on the east side, and kill the two roots shown below. If the abilities shown below do not kill roots completely, it\u2019s fine to ignore them unless they are very high health (5k+), or if the previous root (the next anticlockwise root) is alive also, since roots heal in a clockwise pattern. 4-Man In 4 man, there are more specific root roles.

In duo, the base should target the far arm and DPS should target the close arm. In 4 man, simply target the arm closest to you.

Note that you should freely use all bleeds here, as the DPS will be zerking after coming down from the storm. After the second build to 100 adren, and do the same rotation as P1 (bled + ). Your should be over before the start of rain spec. After , use all TMW bleeds ( + ), then . Optimally, this should be happening just a few abilities before the arms spec, so you should be able to and \u2192 (remember to out of MD to prevent auto) . Regardless, use + and 188s in ZGS to bring Solak to the phase HP. Make sure your adren is high at this time, to be able to + ASAP at the start of P3. If Solak is on you, use TMW bleeds ( + ) first, then build to zerk. Sun afterwards with the same thresholds mentioned before, then ZGS. The DPS should zerk when they come down from the storm, doing the same rotation as P1 (bled \u200e \u200e + ). Afterwards, do a sun rotation similar to the base, aiming to get 2x , 1x and 1x flanking . when you are around 80 adren after the second . Due to the fact that the DPS goes up twice, you have less time for P2, which generally means it\u2019s better to without barging, and for arms. Your rotation here can vary a bit, though, so just use your own judgement and above all make sure you are giving yourself enough time to to + climb the arm. Whilst climbing, you will not be able to melee Solak, so switch to mage and build until he phases. If the HP is quite high at this point, you can use thresholds. Note that you should try to avoid using mage autos around when Solak phases here, as you will end up stalling any autos you use during the phase transition (this forces your next auto to be a mage auto regardless of weapon type, so you will be unable to 5taa in your P3 ). 4-Man: \ud83d\udca6 P2 damage is a bit more important in 4 man kills, since you are not timegated by the arm spec. If Solak is aggro\u2019d on either of the elf 1\u2019s, the base and elf 2 should use mage thresholds and the base should + ( ) \u2192 before building to (mage thresholds can be skipped if low on adrenaline).

This preset also assumes you're camping Standards \u2b25 (Runes for and ) Roles North \ud83d\udc88\ud83d\udc88 Tank Also known as NT or Sand Tank. This person must voke and tank the Sand pool during mirage. Since the DPS will be focused on the other 3 pools first, the NT will be tanking mirage for the longest amount of time. That being said, a defensive rotation is advised as well as using , , and shield dome as effectively as possible. A good way of dealing with this pool is using , then using once a good number of stacks are built in order to receive a good heal, then using and other defensive thresholds/ultimates as needed. Jelly Wrangler This person is to tag, voke and drag jellyfish away from the other players during mirage phase. A maximum number of 10 jellyfish can be present in the instance at one point. Using ice barrage is a good way of dealing with the jellyfish as it will affect multiple targets. Using melee prayer and \u200e \u200eis also critical in reducing damage taken. If enough jellyfish surround the JW, it is very easy to get KO'ed. Using defensives is crucial as killing jellyfish in your party will force Yakamaru to spawn another jellyfish near the team. Bolas can also be used if you are ranging. Main Stun Also \ud83c\udd71 known \ud83d\udc40 as \ud83c\udfff MS. This \u2b07 person will \ud83c\udffb stun Yakamaru during \ud83d\udea3 the \u2795\ud83d\udc76 Stun pool. \ud83c\udf0a It is \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udd71 important \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude0d that \ud83d\ude9f this \ud83d\udc49 is \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc4c the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f ONLY \ud83d\udd66\ud83c\udffc person who stuns the pool. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a It \u2328 is \ud83d\udca6 also important to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 note \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\uddd2 that asphyxiate should \ud83d\udc6b NOT \u2640 be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udca8 used \ud83d\udcc5\ud83d\udcc5 as \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udcb0 main stun; impact/deep impact or \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\udc81 their ranged/melee variants will \ud83d\ude29 be \ud83c\udd70\ud83d\udc1d sufficient. Using \ud83e\udd33\ud83e\udd33 stuns during this \ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffb pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a will \ud83d\udc59\ud83d\udc4f deal 1000 typeless damage to the whole \ud83d\ude29 team \ud83d\udc12 and \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udcd7 drastically reduce Yakamaru's defense.

This \ud83d\ude99 person \ud83d\ude4c must \ud83d\ude4b tank the poison for \ud83d\udc7b each \ud83d\udc4b pool (except \ud83d\ude2e for \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude0d Stun). At \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc4f 100k HP, Yakamaru will \ud83d\udca6 release \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udca6 a \ud83d\udc4c poison \ud83e\udd12\ud83e\udd12 to a \ud83d\udcb0 random \ud83d\udd00\ud83c\udfb2 square and \ud83d\ude07 you \ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc4f will \u26bd have a \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\ude2d few \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\udd1b seconds \ud83d\udd5e to be standing \ud83d\udd2a on \u2b07\ud83d\udd1b this square. The \ud83d\udcaf designated tile will \ud83e\udd17 be \ud83c\udd70\ud83d\udc66 at the \ud83d\udc4c center of four \ud83d\udc71 inward facing green \ud83d\ude1c arrows (this looks \ud83d\udc49 like detonate). Once \ud83d\udcaf you \ud83c\udfff get the confirmation message that \ud83d\ude0d you \ud83d\udc46 have received the \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc68 poison, \ud83e\udd12\ud83e\udd12 you must \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc4f rush \ud83c\udfc3 into \ud83d\udd0d melee distance to Yakamaru (pray \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude4f mage). Once Yakamaru hits 0 \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude0a HP, you \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\ude0f will \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\udc4b be \ud83d\udc1d\u27a1 taken \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude80 to the beach \u26f1 (southeast area of \ud83d\udca6 the \u23e9\u23ea instance) \ud83d\udcaf\ud83e\udd14 and \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc83 the CPR will \ud83d\ude2c revive you. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83d\ude07 Make \ud83d\udd95\ud83d\udcb0 sure \ud83e\udd14 to switch \ud83c\udf9a ranged prayer here. \ud83d\udc47\u2753 If the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udcaa poison \ud83e\udd12\ud83e\udd12 tank misses the \ud83c\udf51 poison or \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udd71 is \ud83d\ude29\ud83c\udd71 not standing MD as \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f the pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a dies, \u26b0 the entire pool \ud83c\udf0a must be \u267f repeated. Stun 0 \ud83d\ude0a Also known \ud83d\udc41 as \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc42 St0 or S0. This person \u2642 must \ud83d\ude20 DPS the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udd11 Stun pool \ud83c\udf0a during \ud83d\udea3\ud83d\udea3 mirage. This \u2b06 person \ud83e\udd1e should \ud83d\udc51 also \ud83d\ude1b follow the same \ud83d\udd95 rotation as \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc8e St5 but \ud83c\udf51 does \u2753\ud83c\udfcb not need to \ud83d\udca6 use \ud83d\udc4f any \ud83c\udf10 planks. This \ud83d\ude29 role is optional as \ud83c\udf51 the \ud83d\ude0d NT \ud83d\udebf may act \ud83c\udfad as a \ud83e\udd82 St0 (this should \ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc51 only be \ud83d\ude10\ud83d\udcb0 done \ud83d\ude02\u2705 if \ud83d\udc4f\u261d you \ud83e\udd16 are \ud83c\udf51 very \ud83d\udc81\ud83d\udc64 experienced). \ud83e\udd33\ud83d\udca8 Stun 5 \ud83d\udc84 Also known as St5 or S5. These 2 people must take 5 planks from the beach and DPS the Stun pool during mirage. A quick way of dealing with this is tagging the pool, \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200eon the pool. Once the pool flies into the air, you and your partner will close the pool with your 5 planks (together, 10 planks are used). Shark 10 Also known as Stag10, SH10, or S10. This person must voke and tank the Shark pool during mirage and then use 10 planks to cover the pool once Yakamaru is defeated. Since most of the DPS will be focused on the Shark pool during mirage, the SH10 will not have to rotate defensive abilities asides from devotion or debilitate. That being said, using devotion then building into / / , using an adrenaline renewal potion and doing a DPS rotation is advised. Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, it will jump into the air and the SH10 must close the pool with their 10 planks so the pool does not respawn. Mechanics Yakamaru has \ud83d\udc4c different mechanics \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 based \ud83c\udfff on the \u2757 pool he \ud83d\ude4e\ud83d\udc68 is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udd1d currently occupying (Choice of tendril, shark, sand, stun, and \u2795 mid). Map of Yakamaru Pools Sand Pool This is \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude2c the \ud83d\udc4f northwestern pool, \ud83c\udf0a it will \ud83d\ude1c always \ud83d\ude2d\u231b follow \ud83d\udc63 the \ud83c\udf46 shark pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a unless \ud83d\udc81\ud83d\ude29 Yakamaru dives to the \ud83d\udc4f sand pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a first. \ud83e\udd47\ud83d\udd22 Yakamaru will use \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f the \"Quick \ud83d\ude2b\ud83c\udfc3 Sand\" special attack here. \ud83d\udea8 During this \ud83d\udc49\u2764 attack, Yakamaru will \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f begin \ud83d\udce6 burying eight random \ud83c\udfb2\ud83d\udd00 players \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 in \ud83d\udc4f the \u23e9 instance (or however \ud83d\udcaf many are in the instance minus \u2796\u2796 2, so \ud83d\ude9f if 8 \ud83d\ude0d remain, 6 will \ud83c\udf51 be affected). \ud83c\udd71 The \ud83d\udd1a two \ud83d\udc6c free \ud83d\udc9c players must click on \ud83d\ude4f the other \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff players in \ud83d\udc86 order \u274c\u274c to \ud83d\udc76\u270c free \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude4b them \ud83d\udc80 from \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udca5 being isnta-killed. If the \ud83d\udd96\ud83d\udc64 base \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22 tank is \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udd70 buried, they \ud83c\udfc1 must be \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc1d freed as \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude16 soon as possible. Typically, the 2 \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude07 unaffected players should \ud83d\udc98\ud83e\udd14 free \ud83d\udd13\u2640 the \ud83d\udeab player closest to \ud83d\udcec\ud83d\ude22 them \ud83d\ude02 and \ud83d\ude29\ud83c\udffd then immediately free \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc4f the base tank. If \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udfc3 you \u2764 are affected by \u26a1 the special \ud83c\udffd\u2604 attack, \u2694 your \ud83d\udc68 defensive abilities (except \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e freedom and anticipation) will \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd34 be \ud83c\udd97\ud83d\ude24 put \ud83d\udc4f on cooldown (you \ud83d\ude4e\ud83c\udfff can still \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc4f use \ud83d\ude0e\u2139 Disruption Shield and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udde3 Shield Dome).

If \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udd1f Yakamaru does the Quick \ud83d\udcd0 Sand \ud83d\udc4d\u26f1 attack \ud83e\udd3c\ud83e\udd3c in \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf5e conjunction to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude31 releasing the \ud83d\udc49 poison, \ud83e\udd12\ud83e\udd12 the \ud83d\udc44 poison \ud83e\udd12 tank and \ud83d\udc4f double may \ud83d\udcc5 not be \ud83d\udc1d able \ud83d\udcaa to \ud83d\ude2f\ud83d\udc49 get the \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc4f poison in \ud83d\udce5 time. If \u2696 Yakamaru is \ud83d\udca6 preparing to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc48 do \ud83d\ude0e the \ud83d\ude9f\u2642 Quick \ud83c\udfff Sand \u26f1\ud83c\udfdd attack \u2694 and \ud83c\udf77 the \ud83d\udc69 HP is \ud83d\udc4f slightly above \ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udc46 100k, the \ud83c\udf81\ud83d\udeaa team \ud83d\udcb0 should slow \u23f3 down \u2b07 on \ud83d\udd1b the \u3299 DPS. If \ud83d\ude29 Yakamaru is close \ud83d\ude0d\u2194 to 0 \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\udc4c HP and \ud83d\udc4f\u23f1 the \ud83d\udc4f poison \ud83e\udd12\ud83e\udd12 tank is \ud83c\udf83 in \ud83d\udce5\u2b07 position \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude2b to \ud83d\ude25 phase and \ud83d\udcb0 Yakamaru is preparing to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 do \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc95 the \ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\udc68 Quick \ud83c\udfff Sand attack, \u2694\ud83e\udd3c the \ud83c\udf81\ud83d\udcd9 team should either \ud83e\udd14 phase \ud83c\udf13 ASAP or \ud83d\udca6 slow \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 down. This \ud83d\udc4f ensures the CPR is \ud83d\ude9f free to \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udde3 save \ud83d\udcd1\ud83d\udcd1 the \ud83d\udc4f poison \ud83e\udd12 tank from the insta-kill. Stun Pool This is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca6 the \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udce9 northeastern pool, \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a it will always \u23f1\ud83d\ude2d follow \ud83d\udc63 Sand \u26f1 Pool \ud83c\udf0a unless \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc81 Yakamaru dives to \u27a1 Stun Pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a first. During this pool, Yakamaru will \ud83d\udc4f not gain a \ud83d\udcaf special \u2604\ud83d\udc69 attack, \u2694 but \ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf51 will \ud83c\udd71\ud83e\udd14 gain \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd3c a \ud83d\udc85 special \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udca6 mechanic. This means that \ud83d\udcaf Yakamaru's special \u270c attack rotation will be: 4 \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udd51 auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 attacks, jellyfish, 4 auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 attacks, blue, \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc99 repeat. \ud83d\udd02\ud83d\udd02 The \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc4f unique \ud83d\udc70 mechanic that Yakamaru gains is \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\ude36 a \ud83c\udf6c defensive buff. \ud83d\udcaa This \ud83d\ude1e buff \ud83d\udcaa increases as \ud83d\ude47 the fight progresses to \ud83d\udd22 the point \u2b06\ud83d\udc47 where Yakamaru will \ud83d\udd95 become \u2642\u2642 invulnerable to \ud83d\udd1f\u27a1 all \ud83d\ude29 attacks except \ud83d\ude2e to \ud83d\udc46 the \ud83c\udf81 style \ud83c\udf4c it \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude29 is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udca6 weak \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude28 against. \ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude0f Yakamaru's weakness \ud83d\ude16 is \u261d indicated by \ud83d\ude08 its \ud83c\udf0f\ud83d\udc4f helmet's color (red \u2668 for \ud83c\udf46\u231b melee, green \ud83d\udcd7 for ranged, blue for \ud83d\udd1c mage) or \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udcb0 the text next \u2603\ud83d\ude3d to Yakamaru's name. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 This \ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\ude02 mechanic is \ud83d\ude10\ud83d\udc4c bypassed by \ud83d\ude08 using a \ud83d\udc90 stun ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 to \ud83d\udd01\ud83d\udca6 drastically lower Yakamaru's defense. Stuns that will \ud83e\udd14 proc this \ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd25 are: asphyxiate, deep \ud83d\ude31 impact, impact, horror, shock, \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude28 tight \ud83d\udc46 bindings, rout, binding \ud83e\udd1d shot, \ud83d\udd2b demoralise, destroy, \ud83d\ude31 stomp, forceful backhand, backhand, and kick. \ud83d\udde1 Dreapnips and \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude0f dominion tower \ud83c\udfec\ud83c\udfec gloves will not stun the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udca6 pool. Once \ud83d\udcaf\u261d a stun is \u274c\ud83d\udc4f used, Yakamaru will \ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udfff reflect damage to \ud83c\udf80\ud83d\udc4c the \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udcd6 team, \ud83d\udc12 the \ud83c\udf0e damage \u2620\u2604 reflected \ud83d\udca1\ud83d\udca1 can be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83c\udd71 anywhere between 1000-5000 damage. \u2604\u2620 This \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc46 damage \u2620 scales to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc80 Yakamaru's current \ud83d\udcb0 defense. If Yakamaru has a \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udd70 very high \ud83d\ude0d\u2328 defense and \ud83d\ude26 a \ud83c\udfcc stun is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udd25 used, \ud83d\ude44\ud83c\udfb6 the \ud83d\udcb0 damage \u2604 reflected \ud83d\udca1\ud83d\udca1 will be \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4c closer \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f to 1000. If Yakamaru has \ud83d\ude31 a low \ud83d\udd3d\u2b07 defense or was \ud83d\ude02 recently \ud83c\udf13\ud83d\ude00 stunned, \ud83d\ude28 the damage \u2620\u2604 will \ud83d\udc6e\ud83d\udc4a be closer \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f to \u2642\u2b06 5000. If \ud83d\udc40 two \ud83d\udc8f players \ud83c\udfae\ud83c\udfae stun Yakamaru at \u2764 the same time, the typeless damage \u2604\u2604 will \ud83e\udd24\u2640 stack, \ud83d\udcda meaning the \ud83d\udc4f team \ud83d\udc12 will instantly \ud83d\udcaf be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d hit for \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcb0 6000 damage. Once \ud83d\udd02\u2049 Yakamaru is \u2764 stunned, you should use \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f high \ud83d\udd1d hitting abilities and \ud83d\udde3 thresholds like snapshot/wild \ud83d\udcf8 magic/hurricane and \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc4f use sacrifice (as it \ud83d\ude11\ud83e\udd14 can \ud83d\udd2b hit \ud83d\udca2\ud83d\udd1e up \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udcb0 to \ud83d\udca6 10k during \ud83c\udfc3 this time). \ud83d\ude24 Using \ud83e\udd33 soulsplit during \ud83c\udfc3 these \ud83d\udcc0\ud83d\udcc0 thresholds is \ud83d\udc4f also \u2795\ud83d\ude47 advised as \ud83c\udfff\ud83c\udf51 it \ud83d\ude45\ud83d\udcaf will \ud83d\udcb0\u2640 drastically cut down on \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udd1b food usage if \ud83d\udc4f done \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 properly. If \ud83d\udcb2 your \ud83d\ude0b double has \ud83e\udd14 done their role properly, \u2611\u2611 you do \ud83d\udc4c not \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab need to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 slow \ud83d\ude33 down \u23ec\u2614 around \ud83d\udd03\ud83c\udf46 100k HP as you \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc49 will already have \ud83c\ude36 a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udf09 poison \ud83e\udd12 tank ready. A fast way to \ud83d\udca6 do \ud83e\udd14 this \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\ude0d pool \ud83c\udf0a is \ud83c\udffb to \ud83d\udde3\ud83d\udca6 have \ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude1d everyone heal to \u2728\ud83d\udd28 full \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4f HP and \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 build \ud83d\udd28\ud83d\udc77 to full \ud83c\udf15\ud83c\ude35 adrenaline, \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 have \ud83d\udca2\ud83c\udd70 someone \u2642 stun, then use \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udd90 onslaught at \ud83e\udd34\ud83d\udc40 the same \u2642 time. \ud83d\ude28\u203c If \ud83c\udf85\ud83d\ude24 executed properly, \u2611\u2611 this will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd14 cut \ud83d\udd2a down \u2b07\ud83d\ude31 on kill \u2620\ud83d\udd2a time fairly noticeably. Shark Pool \ud83c\udf0a This \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udd75 is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4f the western most \ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udd1d pool, \ud83c\udf0a it will \ud83d\udcaf always \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude21 follow \ud83d\udc63 the tendril pool unless \ud83d\udc81\ud83d\ude29 Yakamaru dives to \u27a1\ud83d\udca6 shark pool first. Yakamaru will \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc44 use the \ud83d\udd35 \"Sharknado\" special attack here. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc73 During this \u261d attack, Yakamaru will \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udd71 shroud itself in \ud83d\udeaa a \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udcb0 Sharknado and, \u2795 after \ud83c\udf46 a \ud83d\udebc\ud83d\udc4c few attacks, will release \ud83d\udca6 the sharks. These \ud83d\udd2b\ud83e\udd24 sharks will \ud83d\udc3c land \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf around \ud83d\udd04 Yakamaru and \ud83d\udc86 at \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udf54 the \ud83d\udc4f feet of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 every \ud83d\udcaf player \u2640 in the \ud83d\udca1 fight. \ud83d\udc4a To avoid \ud83d\ude45\ud83d\ude45 tanking the \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd11 ~2 thousand+ \ud83c\udf0a typeless damage, \u2604 you must \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude29 surge/escape/bladed dive away \u26d4 from \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udf46 the sharks or \ud83e\udd5b\ud83c\udfdb kick \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfc3 them \ud83d\udc69 away. \ud83d\ude31\u2640 It is \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude48 highly \u2b06\ud83c\udf3f recommended to surge/escape/bladed dive away as you \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc04 may \u2640 kick \ud83d\udde1 a \ud83d\udc4f shark into \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc49 the \u3299\ud83d\udc4f DPS pile. It is very \ud83d\udc64 important \ud83e\udd23 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 note \ud83d\udcdd that the \ud83d\ude29 sharks will trail you \u2764\ud83d\udc49 until \u23f0 they \u2640\ud83d\udc65 land \ud83d\udeec\ud83d\udcaf on \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udcb0 the \ud83d\udc4f\u231b ground, \ud83d\udc47 meaning \ud83d\udeab that \ud83d\ude27\ud83d\udca6 escaping too early \ud83d\udd50 will \ud83d\ude48 cause \ud83c\udf97 a \ud83d\udc66 shark to \ud83c\udf2c\ud83d\udca6 land \u26f0 at your \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude29 feet and hit \ud83d\udd1e\ud83d\ude0e you \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udca9 (and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f other DPS who \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udeab are near \ud83d\ude2f\ud83d\ude2f you). \ud83d\ude02\u2640 One \ud83d\udc40 method of \ud83d\udca6 dealing \ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc66 with \ud83d\ude09 this \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udce5 is \ud83d\udd25 having \ud83c\udf7d\ud83c\udf7d the \ud83d\ude03 DPS death \ud83d\ude35 dot next to \ud83c\udd94 the \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc68 Tendril pool (southern pool) \ud83c\udf0a during \ud83d\udea3 this special attack. Only \ud83d\udd66\ud83d\udc49 a \ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udcb0 single \u23f1 shark will land next \ud83d\udcc5\u23e9 to \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udd0d the \ud83d\udde3 death dot and can \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udd2b easily \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 be kicked away. This \ud83d\udc46\u2b06 method requires extensive communication and \u261d\ud83d\udc4f is not \ud83c\udffc advised. Immediately after \ud83d\udd51 the sharks land, \ud83d\udcaf a jellyfish will \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f spawn (as \ud83d\ude4c four \ud83d\udc71 auto-attacks \ud83e\udd16 will have \ud83d\ude40\u2623 passed). \u23e9\u23e9 Since \ud83d\udca6 the \ud83c\udfff team \ud83d\udcb0 will be \ud83d\udc1d spread out, make sure to bind the \ud83d\uddbc jellyfish so \ud83d\ude02 that \ud83c\udf08 it \ud83d\ude09 does \u2753\ud83d\ude33 not \u274c\ud83e\udd37 attack \ud83e\udd3c the \u23ea\ud83d\ude9f base tank or the \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\udcb0 DPS pile. As \ud83d\udcb0 poison tank, it \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b is important \ud83d\ude0d\u2705 to \ud83d\udca8\ud83d\udd35 note \ud83d\udccb\ud83d\udcdd that there \ud83c\udd97 may \ud83e\udd37 be more than \ud83d\udc44\ud83d\ude45 one \u2764\ud83d\ude25 shark at \ud83d\udcb0 your \ud83d\udc49 feet \ud83d\udc63 as \ud83d\udcb0 the poison is released. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc45 It \u2754 is advised to \ud83d\udca6\u270c bring \ud83d\udcc9\u27a1 bladed dive in \u2199 order \ud83d\udcd1\u274c to escape \u2650\ud83d\udeeb from \ud83d\ude02 the sharks, dive to \u2642 the \ud83d\ude3c poison, \ud83e\udd12\ud83e\udd12 then \ud83c\udf46 barge to pool \ud83c\udf0a in \u261d the \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f event \ud83d\udc50 that \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc73 the \ud83e\udd89 \"Sharknado\" special \ud83d\udc69 is \ud83d\udca6 unleashed as poison is released.

This person must voke and tank the Sand pool during mirage. Since the DPS will be focused on the other 3 pools first, the NT will be tanking mirage for the longest amount of time. That being said, a defensive rotation is advised as well as using , , and shield dome as effectively as possible. A good way of dealing with this pool is using , then using once a good number of stacks are built in order to receive a good heal, then using and other defensive thresholds/ultimates as needed. Jelly Wrangler This person is to tag, voke and drag jellyfish away from the other players during mirage phase. A maximum number of 10 jellyfish can be present in the instance at one point. Using ice barrage is a good way of dealing with the jellyfish as it will affect multiple targets. Using melee prayer and \u200e \u200eis also critical in reducing damage taken. If enough jellyfish surround the JW, it is very easy to get KO'ed. Using defensives is crucial as killing jellyfish in your party will force Yakamaru to spawn another jellyfish near the team.

Stun 0 \ud83d\ude0a Also known \ud83d\udc41 as \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc42 St0 or S0.

These 2 people must take 5 planks from the beach and DPS the Stun pool during mirage. A quick way of dealing with this is tagging the pool, \u2192 \u2192 \u200e \u200eon the pool. Once the pool flies into the air, you and your partner will close the pool with your 5 planks (together, 10 planks are used). Shark 10 Also known as Stag10, SH10, or S10. This person must voke and tank the Shark pool during mirage and then use 10 planks to cover the pool once Yakamaru is defeated. Since most of the DPS will be focused on the Shark pool during mirage, the SH10 will not have to rotate defensive abilities asides from devotion or debilitate. That being said, using devotion then building into / / , using an adrenaline renewal potion and doing a DPS rotation is advised. Once Yakamaru hits 0 HP, it will jump into the air and the SH10 must close the pool with their 10 planks so the pool does not respawn.","title":"Roles"},{"location":"pvme-guides/high-tier-pvm/yakamaru/#mechanics","text":"Yakamaru has \ud83d\udc4c different mechanics \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 based \ud83c\udfff on the \u2757 pool he \ud83d\ude4e\ud83d\udc68 is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udd1d currently occupying (Choice of tendril, shark, sand, stun, and \u2795 mid).

This means that \ud83d\udcaf Yakamaru's special \u270c attack rotation will be: 4 \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udd51 auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 attacks, jellyfish, 4 auto \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 attacks, blue, \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc99 repeat. \ud83d\udd02\ud83d\udd02 The \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc4f unique \ud83d\udc70 mechanic that Yakamaru gains is \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\ude36 a \ud83c\udf6c defensive buff. \ud83d\udcaa This \ud83d\ude1e buff \ud83d\udcaa increases as \ud83d\ude47 the fight progresses to \ud83d\udd22 the point \u2b06\ud83d\udc47 where Yakamaru will \ud83d\udd95 become \u2642\u2642 invulnerable to \ud83d\udd1f\u27a1 all \ud83d\ude29 attacks except \ud83d\ude2e to \ud83d\udc46 the \ud83c\udf81 style \ud83c\udf4c it \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude29 is \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udca6 weak \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude28 against. \ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude0f Yakamaru's weakness \ud83d\ude16 is \u261d indicated by \ud83d\ude08 its \ud83c\udf0f\ud83d\udc4f helmet's color (red \u2668 for \ud83c\udf46\u231b melee, green \ud83d\udcd7 for ranged, blue for \ud83d\udd1c mage) or \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udcb0 the text next \u2603\ud83d\ude3d to Yakamaru's name. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 This \ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\ude02 mechanic is \ud83d\ude10\ud83d\udc4c bypassed by \ud83d\ude08 using a \ud83d\udc90 stun ability \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 to \ud83d\udd01\ud83d\udca6 drastically lower Yakamaru's defense. Stuns that will \ud83e\udd14 proc this \ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udd25 are: asphyxiate, deep \ud83d\ude31 impact, impact, horror, shock, \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude28 tight \ud83d\udc46 bindings, rout, binding \ud83e\udd1d shot, \ud83d\udd2b demoralise, destroy, \ud83d\ude31 stomp, forceful backhand, backhand, and kick. \ud83d\udde1 Dreapnips and \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude0f dominion tower \ud83c\udfec\ud83c\udfec gloves will not stun the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udca6 pool. Once \ud83d\udcaf\u261d a stun is \u274c\ud83d\udc4f used, Yakamaru will \ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udfff reflect damage to \ud83c\udf80\ud83d\udc4c the \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udcd6 team, \ud83d\udc12 the \ud83c\udf0e damage \u2620\u2604 reflected \ud83d\udca1\ud83d\udca1 can be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83c\udd71 anywhere between 1000-5000 damage. \u2604\u2620 This \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc46 damage \u2620 scales to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc80 Yakamaru's current \ud83d\udcb0 defense. If Yakamaru has a \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udd70 very high \ud83d\ude0d\u2328 defense and \ud83d\ude26 a \ud83c\udfcc stun is \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udd25 used, \ud83d\ude44\ud83c\udfb6 the \ud83d\udcb0 damage \u2604 reflected \ud83d\udca1\ud83d\udca1 will be \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4c closer \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f to 1000. If Yakamaru has \ud83d\ude31 a low \ud83d\udd3d\u2b07 defense or was \ud83d\ude02 recently \ud83c\udf13\ud83d\ude00 stunned, \ud83d\ude28 the damage \u2620\u2604 will \ud83d\udc6e\ud83d\udc4a be closer \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f to \u2642\u2b06 5000. If \ud83d\udc40 two \ud83d\udc8f players \ud83c\udfae\ud83c\udfae stun Yakamaru at \u2764 the same time, the typeless damage \u2604\u2604 will \ud83e\udd24\u2640 stack, \ud83d\udcda meaning the \ud83d\udc4f team \ud83d\udc12 will instantly \ud83d\udcaf be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1d hit for \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcb0 6000 damage. Once \ud83d\udd02\u2049 Yakamaru is \u2764 stunned, you should use \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f high \ud83d\udd1d hitting abilities and \ud83d\udde3 thresholds like snapshot/wild \ud83d\udcf8 magic/hurricane and \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc4f use sacrifice (as it \ud83d\ude11\ud83e\udd14 can \ud83d\udd2b hit \ud83d\udca2\ud83d\udd1e up \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udcb0 to \ud83d\udca6 10k during \ud83c\udfc3 this time). \ud83d\ude24 Using \ud83e\udd33 soulsplit during \ud83c\udfc3 these \ud83d\udcc0\ud83d\udcc0 thresholds is \ud83d\udc4f also \u2795\ud83d\ude47 advised as \ud83c\udfff\ud83c\udf51 it \ud83d\ude45\ud83d\udcaf will \ud83d\udcb0\u2640 drastically cut down on \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udd1b food usage if \ud83d\udc4f done \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 properly. If \ud83d\udcb2 your \ud83d\ude0b double has \ud83e\udd14 done their role properly, \u2611\u2611 you do \ud83d\udc4c not \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab need to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 slow \ud83d\ude33 down \u23ec\u2614 around \ud83d\udd03\ud83c\udf46 100k HP as you \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc49 will already have \ud83c\ude36 a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udf09 poison \ud83e\udd12 tank ready. A fast way to \ud83d\udca6 do \ud83e\udd14 this \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\ude0d pool \ud83c\udf0a is \ud83c\udffb to \ud83d\udde3\ud83d\udca6 have \ud83d\ude40\ud83d\ude1d everyone heal to \u2728\ud83d\udd28 full \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4f HP and \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 build \ud83d\udd28\ud83d\udc77 to full \ud83c\udf15\ud83c\ude35 adrenaline, \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 have \ud83d\udca2\ud83c\udd70 someone \u2642 stun, then use \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udd90 onslaught at \ud83e\udd34\ud83d\udc40 the same \u2642 time. \ud83d\ude28\u203c If \ud83c\udf85\ud83d\ude24 executed properly, \u2611\u2611 this will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd14 cut \ud83d\udd2a down \u2b07\ud83d\ude31 on kill \u2620\ud83d\udd2a time fairly noticeably. Shark Pool \ud83c\udf0a This \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udd75 is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4f the western most \ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udd1d pool, \ud83c\udf0a it will \ud83d\udcaf always \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude21 follow \ud83d\udc63 the tendril pool unless \ud83d\udc81\ud83d\ude29 Yakamaru dives to \u27a1\ud83d\udca6 shark pool first. Yakamaru will \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc44 use the \ud83d\udd35 \"Sharknado\" special attack here. \ud83d\udc4b\ud83d\udc73 During this \u261d attack, Yakamaru will \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udd71 shroud itself in \ud83d\udeaa a \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udcb0 Sharknado and, \u2795 after \ud83c\udf46 a \ud83d\udebc\ud83d\udc4c few attacks, will release \ud83d\udca6 the sharks. These \ud83d\udd2b\ud83e\udd24 sharks will \ud83d\udc3c land \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf around \ud83d\udd04 Yakamaru and \ud83d\udc86 at \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udf54 the \ud83d\udc4f feet of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 every \ud83d\udcaf player \u2640 in the \ud83d\udca1 fight. \ud83d\udc4a To avoid \ud83d\ude45\ud83d\ude45 tanking the \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udd11 ~2 thousand+ \ud83c\udf0a typeless damage, \u2604 you must \ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude29 surge/escape/bladed dive away \u26d4 from \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udf46 the sharks or \ud83e\udd5b\ud83c\udfdb kick \ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udfc3 them \ud83d\udc69 away. \ud83d\ude31\u2640 It is \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude48 highly \u2b06\ud83c\udf3f recommended to surge/escape/bladed dive away as you \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc04 may \u2640 kick \ud83d\udde1 a \ud83d\udc4f shark into \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc49 the \u3299\ud83d\udc4f DPS pile. It is very \ud83d\udc64 important \ud83e\udd23 to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 note \ud83d\udcdd that the \ud83d\ude29 sharks will trail you \u2764\ud83d\udc49 until \u23f0 they \u2640\ud83d\udc65 land \ud83d\udeec\ud83d\udcaf on \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udcb0 the \ud83d\udc4f\u231b ground, \ud83d\udc47 meaning \ud83d\udeab that \ud83d\ude27\ud83d\udca6 escaping too early \ud83d\udd50 will \ud83d\ude48 cause \ud83c\udf97 a \ud83d\udc66 shark to \ud83c\udf2c\ud83d\udca6 land \u26f0 at your \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\ude29 feet and hit \ud83d\udd1e\ud83d\ude0e you \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udca9 (and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f other DPS who \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udeab are near \ud83d\ude2f\ud83d\ude2f you). \ud83d\ude02\u2640 One \ud83d\udc40 method of \ud83d\udca6 dealing \ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc66 with \ud83d\ude09 this \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udce5 is \ud83d\udd25 having \ud83c\udf7d\ud83c\udf7d the \ud83d\ude03 DPS death \ud83d\ude35 dot next to \ud83c\udd94 the \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc68 Tendril pool (southern pool) \ud83c\udf0a during \ud83d\udea3 this special attack. Only \ud83d\udd66\ud83d\udc49 a \ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udcb0 single \u23f1 shark will land next \ud83d\udcc5\u23e9 to \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udd0d the \ud83d\udde3 death dot and can \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udd2b easily \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 be kicked away. This \ud83d\udc46\u2b06 method requires extensive communication and \u261d\ud83d\udc4f is not \ud83c\udffc advised. Immediately after \ud83d\udd51 the sharks land, \ud83d\udcaf a jellyfish will \ud83c\udfff\ud83d\udc4f spawn (as \ud83d\ude4c four \ud83d\udc71 auto-attacks \ud83e\udd16 will have \ud83d\ude40\u2623 passed). \u23e9\u23e9 Since \ud83d\udca6 the \ud83c\udfff team \ud83d\udcb0 will be \ud83d\udc1d spread out, make sure to bind the \ud83d\uddbc jellyfish so \ud83d\ude02 that \ud83c\udf08 it \ud83d\ude09 does \u2753\ud83d\ude33 not \u274c\ud83e\udd37 attack \ud83e\udd3c the \u23ea\ud83d\ude9f base tank or the \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\udcb0 DPS pile. As \ud83d\udcb0 poison tank, it \ud83d\udd2b\ud83d\udd2b is important \ud83d\ude0d\u2705 to \ud83d\udca8\ud83d\udd35 note \ud83d\udccb\ud83d\udcdd that there \ud83c\udd97 may \ud83e\udd37 be more than \ud83d\udc44\ud83d\ude45 one \u2764\ud83d\ude25 shark at \ud83d\udcb0 your \ud83d\udc49 feet \ud83d\udc63 as \ud83d\udcb0 the poison is released. \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc45 It \u2754 is advised to \ud83d\udca6\u270c bring \ud83d\udcc9\u27a1 bladed dive in \u2199 order \ud83d\udcd1\u274c to escape \u2650\ud83d\udeeb from \ud83d\ude02 the sharks, dive to \u2642 the \ud83d\ude3c poison, \ud83e\udd12\ud83e\udd12 then \ud83c\udf46 barge to pool \ud83c\udf0a in \u261d the \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f event \ud83d\udc50 that \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc73 the \ud83e\udd89 \"Sharknado\" special \ud83d\udc69 is \ud83d\udca6 unleashed as poison is released. Tendril Pool The \ud83d\udcb4\ud83c\udf0c southern most pool \ud83c\udf0a is \ud83d\ude33 referred to \u2642\ud83d\udca6 the \ud83d\udd2d \"tendril pool\". \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a In \ud83c\udf1d\ud83d\udc4f this \ud83d\udc48\u2b06 pool, \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a Yaka will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude48 still use the Jellyfish and \ud83d\udc68 Blue \ud83d\ude46\u2642 attacks, but \ud83e\udd1a will also use two \ud83d\udc8f\ud83d\udc24 more \ud83d\ude12\u2795 mechanics. \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 In this \u2b06 pool, \ud83c\udf0a it \ud83c\udffc is \ud83d\udd2a imperative that the \ud83d\udd1a\ud83d\udc4f base \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude3f tank is the first person who \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udcdb tags the \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udc7d pool, \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a otherwise Yakamaru may \ud83e\udd8b\ud83c\udffb unleash a \ud83d\ude9f\u27a1 \"Tendril\" special \ud83d\ude02 attack into \ud83d\udc49 the \ud83c\udf0c DPS pile that will \ud83d\udc51 deal rapid typeless damage. \u2604 The \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udf0a special \ud83d\ude02 attack \u2694\u2694 order will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc always \ud83d\udd54\u23f0 follow \ud83d\udc63 this: jellyfish, blue, \ud83d\udc41 pool \ud83c\udf0a special. \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf For \ud83d\ude18 the \u2642\ud83d\ude0e southern pool, the tendril special \ud83c\udf81 attack \u2694 will be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83c\udd70 the \u261d third special. \ud83d\udc69 Keeping this in mind, \ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udd70 it is \ud83d\ude29 possible to \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udf51 use resonance on every \ud83d\ude30 single \ud83d\udc91 jellyfish spawn outside \ud83d\udeaa\ud83d\udeaa of \ud83c\udf3e middle pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a (assuming \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 you \ud83d\ude29 tag \ud83d\udd1e\ud83d\udd1e the \ud83c\udf28\u2642 jellyfish and Yakamaru does \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udeab not snipe your \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udcaf res) and \ud83d\udc74\ud83d\ude4f maintain a high HP level \ud83c\udf52\ud83c\udd99 without \ud83d\udeab eating.

At this point, \u2b06\ud83d\udd18 the \u2744\ud83d\udcac SH10 and \ud83d\udc4f two St5's should \ud83d\udc98 get \ud83c\ude50 their \ud83d\ude34 planks and \u2795\ud83d\udca6 position \ud83d\ude2b themselves \ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc69 near \ud83d\ude2f\ud83d\ude2f their \ud83c\udffb pools. \ud83c\udfca The \ud83d\udc4f NT \ud83d\udcb0 and Base \ud83d\udc7a\ud83d\ude35 Tank should also \ud83d\udc68 position \ud83d\ude2b\ud83c\udfff themselves \ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udc67 near \ud83d\ude2f\ud83d\ude2f their pools as the phase \ud83c\udf17 continues.

The \ud83d\udc67\ud83d\ude18 pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a should \ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udd71 close after \ud83c\udf4a a \ud83d\udc4f few seconds. \ud83d\udd5a Both \ud83c\udf46 St5's will \ud83d\udcb0 click on \ud83d\ude0e the \u26d3 pool \ud83c\udf0a and \ud83c\udf85 use \ud83d\udc4f their 5 planks to \u270c close the \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf3e pool. \ud83c\udf0a If \ud83d\udc4f\u2642 the \ud83e\udd14 pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a is \ud83d\udde1\ud83d\udcaa not \ud83d\ude45\ud83d\ude45 closed, \ud83d\udeab the \u2935\ud83d\ude09 pool will \ud83c\udd71 respawn and \ud83c\udf30 must \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude21 be \ud83d\ude24 repeated. It is \u2705\ud83d\udca6 important \u2705 to \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udfb6 NOT \ud83d\ude45\u274c use \u2139 stuns on this pool, \ud83c\udf0a as \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\ude10 the \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc4f stun mechanic will still \ud83c\udf7a be present. Stun Pool \ud83c\udf0a (Mirage) The \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f NT \ud83d\udcb0 will tag \ud83d\udd1e the \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc93 Stun pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a to \ud83d\udcb0 draw \ud83d\udd19 aggression and then provoke the \ud83d\udce9\u2744 Sand \u26f1\ud83c\udf35 pool, then use \ud83d\ude80 devotion to negate incoming damage from \ud83d\ude02 both \ud83c\udf1c pools. The \ud83d\udc4f St5's and \u2694 the \ud83d\udebd\ud83c\udf0a St0 will \ud83d\udccc\ud83d\udca6 use devotion, drink \ud83d\udeb1 an \ud83d\ude23 adrenaline \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 potion (or \ud83c\udd71\ud83c\udffc replenishment potion), \ud83c\udf7e and \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude29 then \ud83d\udd5b use \ud83d\udc4f\u274c onslaught. The \ud83d\udcac\ud83d\udca6 pool should \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude24 close \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude1c after a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\ude9f few \ud83d\udd22 seconds. Both \ud83c\udf1c\ud83c\udf1c St5's will click on \ud83d\udc5e the pool and \ud83d\ude9f use \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 their 5 \ud83d\udd90\ud83e\udd90 planks to \ud83c\udd71 close \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\udeab the pool. If \u261d\ud83d\ude31 the \ud83d\udca6 pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a is not \ud83d\ude47 closed, the \ud83d\udc69 pool will \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udd71 respawn and \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udcb0 must \ud83d\ude4b\ud83d\udd12 be \ud83d\udc4c repeated. It \ud83d\udca9 is \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc4f important \u2705 to \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4c NOT use stuns on \ud83d\udd1b\ud83d\udc47 this \ud83d\ude1e pool, \ud83c\udf0a as \ud83c\udf51 the \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\udde3 stun mechanic will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f still be \ud83e\udd5c\ud83d\udc6c present. The NT should then \ud83d\udd70\ud83d\ude0e move to the \ud83d\ude22 north \u261d\ud83d\udc88 of the \ud83d\ude9f Sand \ud83d\udc4d pool and the \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf1c St5's and \ud83c\udf46 St0 should \ud83d\udc98 move \ud83d\udc4a to \ud83d\ude9f Shark pool. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a Shark Pool \ud83c\udf0a The \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc4f SH10 should \ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd14 be positioned to \ud83c\udd71 the \ud83d\udcaf south \ud83d\udc47 of the \ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udff3 pool. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a They \ud83d\udc4f will tag \ud83d\udd1e the pool, \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a voke, use \ud83d\udc4f devotion, build to \ud83d\ude2f 100% \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf and \ud83d\udc66\ud83c\udfff then \ud83d\udc71 do \ud83e\udd24 a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udea8 DPS rotation. The \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f four free \ud83c\udd93\ud83d\udc9c DPS should \ud83d\ude0e move \u2642\ud83d\udc4a to \ud83d\udce7 the \ud83d\udc67\ud83d\udeaa east \ud83c\udf0d\ud83d\udc49 of the \ud83d\udc4f pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a and \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc4f also \ud83d\ude1b\u2795 do a \ud83c\udfcc\ud83c\udf6c DPS rotation. If \ud83d\ude29\ud83c\udffc the DPS is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca6 optimal, Yakamaru will only \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc4f unleash \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08 two \ud83c\udf84\ud83c\udf84 special \ud83d\udcaf attacks. Once the \ud83d\uddef pool \ud83c\udf0a hits 0 \ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e HP, the SH10 will \ud83d\udd95 use \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4f all \ud83d\udc49\ud83e\udd52 10 \ud83d\udcaf planks to \ud83d\udc6e cover the \ud83d\udc85 pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a and \u2795 then \ud83d\udd19 use \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udcf1 freedom to \ud83d\ude16 halve the \u26b0\ud83d\udc4f number \ud83d\udcdf of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude0e aggression stacks \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 they \ud83d\ude02 have. \ud83d\udc4c The \u2728\ud83d\udc68 SH10 and \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\ude19 free \ud83c\udfc7 DPS should \ud83c\udd71 then \ud83d\udc8e remain \ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udc40 in \ud83d\udd2b their sunshines/death's swiftnesses and \ud83d\ude08 attack Tendril pool. If \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udd0e the DPS is \ud83c\udfa4\ud83d\udd25 not sufficient, the \ud83c\udf11\ud83d\udc68 SH10 should \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 use resonance, freedom, then \ud83d\udc93\ud83c\udf46 rotate defensives to reduce incoming damage. \u2604 The incoming DPS from the St5's and \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\udc56 St0 should be \ud83d\udc1d enough \ud83d\udca6 and \u270a the pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a should close. \ud83d\ude0d\u2194 Tendril Pool \ud83c\udf0a The \ud83d\ude9f Base \ud83d\ude3f Tank will be \ud83d\udc1d south \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 east \ud83d\udc49 of \ud83d\ude13 the \ud83d\udd1a\ud83c\udf85 Tendril Pool and must \ud83d\udcb0 tank the \ud83d\udcd6 pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a until \ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udd71 after Shark Pool \ud83c\udf0a is \ud83d\ude27\ud83c\ude01 finished. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude18 The \ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\udc10 special \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udffd attack rotation will \ud83d\udc4a remain \ud83d\udd15 the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f same, \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udca9 meaning the \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udd71 Base \ud83d\udc7a Tank's rotation should \ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc98 remain \ud83d\udd15\ud83d\udc4f the \u26b0\ud83d\udc4f same. \u2640 Once \ud83c\udd71 Shark Pool is \ud83c\udd70\ud83e\udd1a closed, \ud83d\udeab the DPS will \ud83c\udffc focus \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude29 on \u2796\ud83d\udd1b Tendril Pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a and \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude2c it should be \ud83d\udc1d\u2714 closed \ud83d\udeab before anyone \ud83d\udc66 is \u267b choked. Once \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udd71 the pool hits 0 \ud83d\ude0f HP, the \ud83c\udf0a DPS and Base Tank MUST \ud83d\ude21 spam \ud83d\udd01\ud83d\udd01 click on the \ud83c\udf8a pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a in \ud83d\udc49 order to add \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc48 buckets of \ud83d\udca6 sand \u26f1 and \ud83d\udc4f close \ud83d\ude0d the pool. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a Every \u24dc player \ud83d\udcb0\u2640 can only \ud83d\udca6 add \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\udc48 2 buckets \ud83c\udf6f\ud83c\udf6f of \ud83d\udddc sand, meaning \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\udeab a \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udc4c minimum of 5 people \ud83d\udc66 are needed to close the \ud83d\udc49 pool on \ud83d\udd1b the \ud83d\udc66 first \ud83e\udd47\ud83c\udffb try. \ud83c\udfc3 If the pool \ud83c\udf0a isn't closed \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab in \u27a1 time, \ud83c\udffb it \ud83e\udd14 must \ud83d\udcb0 be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc84 repeated. If \ud83d\udeab the pool is \ud83d\uddd1\ud83d\ude02 repeated, the \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb0 Base \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\udc7a Tank must \ud83d\udd10\ud83d\udcaf provoke the \u26d3\ud83c\udfb5 pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a off \ud83d\ude2b the \ud83d\ude39 DPS or risk having a tendril spawn in \ud83d\ude0f the DPS pile. It \ud83d\ude29 is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude24 important \u2705\ud83e\udd23 to note that \ud83d\ude10 buckets of sand \ud83d\udd25\u26f1 added \u2795\u2795 to the \ud83d\ude22\ud83c\udf0e pool \ud83c\udf0a during previous attempts will \ud83d\udc4f carry over. \u2935\ud83d\ude0f This \ud83d\udc40\ud83c\udf84 means \ud83d\ude3c\ud83e\udd14 if \u2708 6 buckets of \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 sand \ud83c\udfdd\ud83d\udd25 are \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udcc9 added \u2795\u2795 during \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udea3 the first attempt, only 4 \ud83d\udca6 buckets \ud83c\udf6f\ud83c\udf6f of \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd6f sand are needed to \ud83d\udca6 close the pool on \ud83d\udc4b the \ud83d\udc4f next \ud83d\udcc5 attempt. Once the \ud83c\udd71\ud83d\udc4f pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a is over, everyone becomes \ud83d\udcc9 DPS and \ud83d\udc4f moves \ud83d\udc83 to \ud83d\udca6 Sand pool. Sand Pool \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a The \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc4f NT will \ud83c\udf61 be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\ude0e north \u261d of \ud83d\udca6 the \ud83e\udd20\ud83c\udf08 pool and be \ud83d\ude10 tanking auto \ud83e\udd16 attacks.

Walking \ud83d\udeb6\ud83d\udeb6 Bosses (Courtesy of \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udca6 #pavu) Moving NPCs \u2b25 In \ud83c\udf5e RS, bosses only \ud83d\udc68 walk East, \ud83d\udc49 West, or \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udeab South \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 (never North). \ud83d\udc88\ud83d\udc88 The direction they \ud83d\udc67 walk \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udeb6 is random \ud83c\udfb2 at first, \ud83e\udd47 but \u270b they \ud83d\udc65 will always \ud83d\ude0d walk \ud83d\udeb6 in \ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udc4f that \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udd71 direction afterwards. \u2b25 Hitting a wall \u2328\u2328 changes walking behavior \ud83d\ude26 in \u2764 the following ways: \u2714 an \ud83d\udc89\u3030 east-walking boss \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc68 will \u26bd turn \u2757\ud83c\udfc3 west, a \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc69 west-walking boss \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udcbc will \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f turn \ud83d\ude9f south, \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 and \ud83d\udc4f a \ud83d\udc66\u2764 south-walking \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 boss \ud83d\udc68 will \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\udc4f turn either \ud83d\ude24 east or \ud83d\udd2e west. The \ud83d\ude46 Araxxor Walking \ud83d\udeb6 Guide demonstrates this \ud83e\udd20 behavior: \u2642 https://youtu.be/A_6ah7GF_1k \ud83e\udd11\ud83d\ude0e Applications \u2b25 The simplest of these includes walking a bleed such as Combust , Fragmentation Shot , or Slaughter . Below is a demonstation of this (Courtesy of #Unknown user): https://youtu.be/0Y0JGMeLcmI \ud83e\udd11\ud83d\ude2e Note: A more advanced version of this is using a bleed, and then immediately using Surge to go under the boss and Bladed Dive to get back all within a GCD. This allows you to double bleed damage against bosses when you aren't MD. \u2b25 Walking \ud83d\udeb6\ud83d\udeb6 can \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 also \ud83d\udc68 be \ud83d\udc97\ud83e\udd14 used \ud83c\udfed\ud83d\udcc5 to \ud83e\udd14 reposition a \ud83d\udc4f boss, \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc68 such \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude01 as \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc4f fixing \ud83d\udd27\ud83d\udd50 base \ud83d\ude44 spot on \ud83d\udd1b P2 Vorago, moving Vorago out \ud83d\udc40 of \ud83d\udc23 green \ud83d\udcb0 bomb mists, and moving Telos out \ud83d\ude27 of beams. Note: Keep in mind that most bosses move at 2 squares per tick (same speed as you), so for bosses that you don\u2019t want to walk, you should move an even number of squares to prevent unwanted movement. Manual Spell \ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udd24 Casting (Courtesy of \ud83d\udd27 #Linie and \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udc4f #nadir) Saving Rune Costs \u2b25 Magic auto attacks deal damage based on the spell your weapon is set to. The Surge , Blitz , and Barrage spells deal damage scaling up to T92 while other spells are capped at a lower tier. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Particularly, the Aurora spells are capped at T90 damage and below, making them undesirable to use despite their secondary effects. \u2b25 However, \ud83d\udcb0 this issue \u2642\u2642 is \ud83d\udca6 resolved with \ud83d\ude0d\ud83c\udffd manual spell casting found in \ud83d\ude08\ud83c\udf1d the combat settings.

This means you should always try to Detonate a monster that is north east of another monster to maximize the amount of targets hit. \u2b25 Here is a general \u2642 diagram showcasing \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6 the above \ud83d\udc46 visuals in \ud83c\udffc\u2642 the \ud83c\udf43 context \ud83d\udcdd\ud83d\ude0e of a \ud83d\udc4c 3x3 AoE being used: .

Early \ud83d\udd50\ud83e\udd42 Slayer \ud83d\udca6 tasks offer poor \ud83d\ude25 XP rates, \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaf so \ud83d\udcaf the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udd75 player \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\ude24 should aim to \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udcb4 gain \ud83d\udd3c slayer \ud83c\udf46 XP from \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 other \ud83d\udc6a methods, such as \ud83c\udf51\ud83d\udca6 squashing Scarabs in Menaphos, Reaper tasks or completing quests. Most \ud83d\udc36 tasks below level 85 offer low \u2b07 XP mobs, however a \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc40 greater \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\udc45 demon \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79 task can be \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udf08 used \ud83c\udd92\ud83c\udfed to power \ud83d\udcaf level \ud83c\udd99\ud83d\udd3b slayer \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca6 with the \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udd2f aid of \ud83d\udc4f the \ud83d\udc40 Demon Flashmobs distraction & diversion. If the \ud83d\ude04 player \u2640\ud83e\udd37 with \ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udc4f the \ud83d\ude17 greater demon \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc79 task is \ud83d\udca6 the \ud83d\udcb0 first \ud83d\udc46 person to tag the \ud83d\udc8a boss, \ud83d\udc68 they will recieve the \ud83d\udc44\ud83d\udc69 full \ud83c\ude35 22.4k XP, which \u270c\u2753 can be increased to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udcb8 33.6k XP with the \ud83d\udc15 scrimshaw of \ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd57 sacrifice. With \ud83d\udc4f these \ud83d\ude91 methods, low-level, \u2b07 poor \ud83c\udffe XP tasks can \ud83d\udd2b be \ud83d\udca6 avoided. Since \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 AoE damage is \ud83c\ude36 the \ud83d\udc7b\ud83d\udc66 king of \ud83d\udd1f\ud83d\udca6 slayer, \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 a \ud83c\udf81\u26a1 lot \u203c of lower \u2b07\ud83d\ude0e and \u2795 higher \u2705 levelled slayer tasks are generally done \ud83d\udcaf with melee, with \ud83d\ude24 a halberd weapon, making \ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc46 melee the \ud83d\udc4f main overall style \ud83d\udc80 when slaying. However, \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udd90 both \ud83d\udc6c\ud83d\udc66 magic and ranged have \u2642\ud83d\udc68 their \ud83d\udc67 own \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\ude41 sets of \ud83d\udddc\ud83d\udca6 tasks that \ud83d\udc49 they \ud83d\udcda\ud83d\ude08 are \ud83c\udffb best \ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc42 for, \ud83c\udf46 especially at \ud83e\udd23 the \ud83d\udc7d\ud83d\ude97 higher end, so all \ud83d\ude0b\u270b three \ud83d\udc68 styles are recommended to \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 be \u27a1 used. Presets Some \ud83d\udca6 basic \ud83c\udf11 presets are \ud83d\udc93 shown below \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b Basic Melee Preset Basic Magic Preset Basic Ranged Preset https://i.imgur.com/E9ZWpX4.png \ud83e\udd14 Note: The gear shown above isn't indicative of what one should wear on every slayer task, as many tasks require specific gear or items, the presets are just a general idea of what to remember to take with you. Items in x box represent potions that should be taken to every task, weapons and amulets that should be considered are in y box. The z box is relevant for cannon-able tasks, and a box represents items that should be taken to all tasks, especially the slayer cape for a quick teleport to a slayer master. Action \ud83e\udd1a\ud83d\udcaa Bars \ud83d\ude02\u26d3 Some base \ud83d\ude35 action \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa bars \ud83c\udf6c are shown \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udeab below \u2b07\u2b07 Basic Melee Afk Bar Basic Magic Afk Bar Basic Ranged Afk Bar Note: Specific tasks may require their own action bars, due to requiring certain abilities like Devotion :devo:513190158728953857> or Anticipate in a specific spot, or if AoE is not required. These bars should be taken as a baseline and not as the absolute best bar. The ranged bar assumes 1v1 combat, as AoE ranged is usually in the form of Mechanised Chinchompas . If gFury is not owned, shift everything up one slot and put Slice at the end. Slayer \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf46 Tips General Tips and Tricks \u2b25 There are a lot of tasks that benefit from using aggression potions to lure mobs together, often in conjunction with the Dwarven Multicannon or Oldak Coil to achieve a stronger effect. \u2b25 Prayer restoring items, such as Super Restores or Super Prayer Renewals are extremely cheap, so prayers should always be used when slaying. \u2b25 As soon as the player hits 105 , the highest priority is to obtain the Dinosaur Tooth drop, a 1/800 drop from slayer creatures on Anachronia. The droprate is further boosted under the effect of the Osseous Roar, to 1/720. Whilst 105 is not required, the lowest level slayer creature on anachronia is level 90 , Venomous dinosaurs are easily afk-able and give high kph. The Dinosaur Tooth is used to build the slayer helmet stand, which allows the Slayer Helm buff to be available at all times without wearing it, making it extremely ideal for all slayer tasks. \u2b25 Slayer \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\udca6 points \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc41 should \ud83d\udc98\ud83d\udc98 be \ud83d\udcd6\ud83d\udc1d spent \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 Firstly on building a good block + prefer list, unlocking good tasks such as Nightmare creatures, and upgrading the Slayer Helm . \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 After \ud83d\udc45\ud83d\ude29 that, tooltbelt upgrades for \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude23 the \ud83d\udc4f seedicide, gold \ud83d\udcb0\ud83e\udd13 accumulator, bonecrusher and \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4f charming imp, then abilities such as \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udf51 broader fletching and crafting slayer \ud83d\udca6 rings. \ud83d\udc42\ud83d\udc8d \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 If the \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udd71 player \ud83e\udd3a plans to \ud83d\udd1c do \ud83d\udc49 Gargoyles early \ud83e\udd42\ud83e\udd42 on, \ud83d\udd1b\ud83c\udf81 Finishing blows is \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude0d a \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc1d higher priority, \u2b06\u2b06 however \ud83d\udcb0 a \ud83c\udfcc Legendary \ud83d\udc8e Pet can be used for \ud83d\ude9f the \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udffb same \ud83d\udc6d effect \ud83d\udc06 without \ud83d\udc79\u2640 purchasing the \ud83d\udde3 ability.

Useful Items Whilst no special items are required to kill Camel Warriors, prayer restoring items like the Ancient Elven Ritual Shard can be used in conjunction with other methods of restoring prayer, due to the heavy prayer drain. Method \u2b25 Camel warriors have one \u267f\ud83d\udc4f main mechanic, similar \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf to \ud83d\ude14 that of Glacors. After taking \ud83d\udc85 some \ud83c\udfe0 damage, \u2604\u2620 they split into \u23e9 3 \ud83c\udffc mirages, Blood, \ud83d\udca6 Smoke \ud83c\udf2b and \ud83d\udc4f Shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 mirages.

Shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 mirages drain the \ud83d\udee3 player's prayer \ud83d\udc7c points \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udcdd after \ud83d\udc40\u23f3 charging the \ud83c\udf81\ud83d\udc2b bar \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b above \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb their \ud83d\udc48 heads, \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\udca4 Blood mirages heal the \ud83d\udc4f other mirages for \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude0d ~900 HP per \ud83d\udc7c\ud83d\udc7c attack, and Smoke mirages cast the Confuse, Weaken and \ud83c\udd97\ud83c\udfff Snare spells on the \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udc89 player, \ud83d\ude24 reducing hitchance and \ud83d\udc4f damage \u2604 by 5%, \ud83d\ude4b\ud83d\ude31 and \ud83d\udcaf freezing you \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udcaf in place for 10s. \u2b25 As mentioned above, killing them in the Player-Owned Slayer dungeon is the optimal way of killing Camel Warriors. Enter the large room with 100% adrenaline, and damage all 3 of the camel warriors to spawn their mirages. Exit the room, and wait for the mirages to stack up by the door, drop out of combat to losslessly Devotion and use Berserk + Adrenaline Renewal , enter the room and aoe the mirages down, using \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 , then thresholds to finish off the respawned Camel Warriors. This is a good time to use Tuska's Wrath and build adrenaline for the next wave. Once the camel warriors respawn, repeat the same method. Note: Camel Warrior mirages do not count as targets for Ruthless or Bladed Dive , so they do not refresh it's cooldown when killed. Therefore the Mobile perk is recommended. Melee Preset Video Guide https://youtu.be/uR8aBGt7uB8 Acheron Mammoths Stats \u2b25 \u200e \u200eXP per kill : 2508 + 827.6 HP \u2b25 \u200e \u200eXP per kill : 4215.6 \u2b25 Optimal kills per \ud83d\udc7c hour: 275 \u2b25 Optimal XP per hour : ~1.1m XP/h Desirable Drops Acheron Mammoths have a guaranteed unique drop of their Mammoth Tusk, which is an ingredient in making Pack Mammoth pouches. In addition to this, they have a rich drop table, with each kill worth roughly 50k, making the tasks decent for GP alongside XP. Mammoths also provide a large amount of crimson and blue charms, dropping 4 at a time. Location and How to Get There Mammoths are located on the Mammoth Iceberg, accessible via \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 a \ud83d\udcb0 boat to the \u2795\u2702 north of \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc4c the \ud83d\udc4f Fremenik Lodestone. Useful Items \u2b25 Magic \ud83d\udcff\u2728 Notepaper - useful to note \ud83d\uddd2 the tusks for \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\ude29 extra \ud83d\ude1c GP. \u2b25 Dominion Mines - provide 20k extra damage every minute. Method \u2b25 Mammoths have 2 main special attacks, a charge, and a smite attack. The charge deals large melee damage, hits up to 3 times, and is indicated by the mammoth shaking and the blue bar above it's head fills up. To avoid this, simply pray and allow it to hit you, or move out of the way. The smite attack is caused by being outside of the mammoth's attack range when in combat with it, to deal with it stay melee distance as much as possible. \u2b25 Mammoths attack with both melee and range hits, range hits have the animation of the mammoth throwing a large ice rock at the player's location, and can be avoided by moving out of the way. They can also sometimes throw 3 rocks at a time, so make sure to pray or move. \u2b25 The best method to deal with Mammoths is to AoE as many of them as you can, using the Noxious Scythe for the extended range. Stand in the area shown below, sip an aggression potion, pray and use AoEs such as Hurricane , Bladed Dive , Quake , Cleave , and Meteor Strike to deal large AoE damage. Remember to put dominion mines down every minute, and utilise Berserk and Zgs Spec to deal more damage. Use lossless healing food such as Saradomin Brews and Blue Blubber Jellyfish to keep hp up, alongside a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism . Due to a low hitchance without a stab weapon, an accuracy boosting aura such as / should be used. \u2b25 Melee is the best way to kill mammoths, however magic with the Inquisitor's staff can also be viable. The strategy is less aoe-focused with magic, and make sure to stay in melee distance to avoid the smite attack. Try to use your Sunshine in an area where many mammoths can be reached, as to avoid getting smited.

This is a powerful t85 crossbow, dropped at a rate of 1/2000 on-task and 1/10,000 off-task. Location and How to Get There Living \ud83d\ude2e Wyverns are \ud83d\udca6 located inside \ud83c\udfe0 the Asgarnian Ice Dungeon, accessed via a rope \u27b0 in \ud83c\udf4c the south of the \ud83d\udc10\ud83d\udc49 Skeletal Wyvern room. The easiest way to get \ud83c\ude50\ud83e\udd23 there \ud83d\ude0d would \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc4d be via \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 the Port Sarim lodestone and run \ud83c\udfc3 south \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 to \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\ude45 the \ud83d\udc66 dungeon entrance, then \u27a1 take \ud83d\udc68 the agility shortcut directly \u27a1\u27a1 east of \u2620 the \ud83d\udc4f\u2702 ladder. \ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2 Alternatively, the fairy ring \ud83d\udc8d A.I.Q \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc4c can be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udca6 used to \ud83d\udca6\u270c get \ud83d\ude22 to \u27a1\ud83d\udc49 Mudskipper Point. \u2b06\u2b06 Useful Items \u2b25 To avoid the majority of the Wyvern's breath damage, a potion that blocks Wyrmbreath must be used, such as an overload salve variant or a Wyrmfire potion. \u2b25 Dominion Mines - used to deal 2 large hits every minute, significantly lowering the hp of one Wyvern. \u2b25 Bonecrusher - with the \ud83d\udeaa bonepicker upgrade from \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\udc49 the \ud83d\udc96 Arc, this \ud83d\ude9f\u261d is \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udd70 extremely useful for \ud83d\udcb0 picking up \ud83c\udffb\u261d Wyvern bones, \u26cf where \ud83d\ude20\u2642 they can \ud83d\udee2 be \ud83d\udc7c\ud83d\udc1d easily \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude03 noted whilst \ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9 continuing to kill \ud83d\udd2a Wyverns. \u2b25 Death \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\udc80 Note \ud83d\udcdd Relic - Automatically notes dropped bones and \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude1f ashes. With \ud83d\ude0e the \ud83d\udc06 bonepicker upgrade, this \ud83c\udfc4 automatically picks up \ud83d\ude0d noted bones. \ud83c\udf46 Method \u2b25 The main mechanic to look out for when killing Wyverns is the frost % that builds up the more time you spend in the cave. Standing next to a lit fire reduces the frost quickly, but should only be done when required. The frost % has different effects depending on how cold the player is. When the player first enters, the Wyvern's poison damage will be large, hitting for up to 900 per hitsplat, however this is reduced to around 300 damage when the frost reaches 25%. After this, the Wyvern's auto-attack damage is increased up to 2500, and when the frost reaches 100% the player is frozen and stunned for 10 seconds. If this happens, the player should leave the cave, or use and immediately stand next to a fire. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude02 is optimal to keep frost above \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc46 25% \ud83d\udc4f and below \u2b07\u2b07 100, \ud83d\udcaf and \ud83d\udc40\u23f1 spend as little \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\udc67 time as \ud83c\udfff possible \ud83d\udd1d next \ud83c\udf28\ud83d\ude38 to a fire \u2b25 Living Wyverns can hit quite hard with their range and magic auto-attacks, but in melee distance deal less damage. Wyverns are stunnable, so they can be stunned repeatedly to avoid taking damage at all. is used to regain lifepoints, and the Wyverns are fought in single combat. \u2b25 Melee - Melee is good at Wyverns, as being melee distance reduces the damage taken, and due to their low hp they can be killed extremely quickly when under the effects of Berserk . Utilising movement abilities such as Bladed Dive and gBarge should be prioritised, to hop quickly between the Wyverns. In the middle of the room there is a Wyvern spawn that is next to a fire, aim to attack that spawn when the frost is getting close to 100%. Due to their spread spawns, usage of the Zgs Spec isn't recommended, however a TMW Spear can be utilised effectively to increase kph. Casting Slaughter and Dismember and moving on to another Wyvern is recommended if the hits are high, and if utilising gBarge , bled thresholds can be applied from a distance to high hp targets. \u2b25 Magic - Magic is the best style at wyverns, due to their weakness to the Inquisitor's staff . Stand close to a fire, and simply damage Wyverns within range. Wyverns are stunnable and bindable, so Ice Blitz + Wrack can be a powerful combo. Blood spells help with healing, alongside Vampyrism aura if required. The fire directly to the west of the rope has a spawn that Dominion Mines can be placed next to every minute for two 7k hits.

Useful Items Whilst no special items are required to kill Camel Warriors, prayer restoring items like the Ancient Elven Ritual Shard can be used in conjunction with other methods of restoring prayer, due to the heavy prayer drain. Method \u2b25 Camel warriors have one \u267f\ud83d\udc4f main mechanic, similar \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf to \ud83d\ude14 that of Glacors. After taking \ud83d\udc85 some \ud83c\udfe0 damage, \u2604\u2620 they split into \u23e9 3 \ud83c\udffc mirages, Blood, \ud83d\udca6 Smoke \ud83c\udf2b and \ud83d\udc4f Shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 mirages. These \ud83c\udf46 have their own unique \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c effects, and attack \ud83e\udd3c with \ud83d\udc69 magic \u2728 attacks. Shadow \ud83d\udc64\ud83d\udc64 mirages drain the \ud83d\udee3 player's prayer \ud83d\udc7c points \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udcdd after \ud83d\udc40\u23f3 charging the \ud83c\udf81\ud83d\udc2b bar \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b above \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb their \ud83d\udc48 heads, \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\udca4 Blood mirages heal the \ud83d\udc4f other mirages for \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude0d ~900 HP per \ud83d\udc7c\ud83d\udc7c attack, and Smoke mirages cast the Confuse, Weaken and \ud83c\udd97\ud83c\udfff Snare spells on the \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udc89 player, \ud83d\ude24 reducing hitchance and \ud83d\udc4f damage \u2604 by 5%, \ud83d\ude4b\ud83d\ude31 and \ud83d\udcaf freezing you \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udcaf in place for 10s. \u2b25 As mentioned above, killing them in the Player-Owned Slayer dungeon is the optimal way of killing Camel Warriors. Enter the large room with 100% adrenaline, and damage all 3 of the camel warriors to spawn their mirages. Exit the room, and wait for the mirages to stack up by the door, drop out of combat to losslessly Devotion and use Berserk + Adrenaline Renewal , enter the room and aoe the mirages down, using \u2192 \u2192 \u2192 , then thresholds to finish off the respawned Camel Warriors. This is a good time to use Tuska's Wrath and build adrenaline for the next wave. Once the camel warriors respawn, repeat the same method. Note: Camel Warrior mirages do not count as targets for Ruthless or Bladed Dive , so they do not refresh it's cooldown when killed. Therefore the Mobile perk is recommended.

In addition to this, they have a rich drop table, with each kill worth roughly 50k, making the tasks decent for GP alongside XP. Mammoths also provide a large amount of crimson and blue charms, dropping 4 at a time. Location and How to Get There Mammoths are located on the Mammoth Iceberg, accessible via \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 a \ud83d\udcb0 boat to the \u2795\u2702 north of \ud83d\udc68\ud83d\udc4c the \ud83d\udc4f Fremenik Lodestone.

Method \u2b25 Mammoths have 2 main special attacks, a charge, and a smite attack. The charge deals large melee damage, hits up to 3 times, and is indicated by the mammoth shaking and the blue bar above it's head fills up. To avoid this, simply pray and allow it to hit you, or move out of the way. The smite attack is caused by being outside of the mammoth's attack range when in combat with it, to deal with it stay melee distance as much as possible. \u2b25 Mammoths attack with both melee and range hits, range hits have the animation of the mammoth throwing a large ice rock at the player's location, and can be avoided by moving out of the way. They can also sometimes throw 3 rocks at a time, so make sure to pray or move. \u2b25 The best method to deal with Mammoths is to AoE as many of them as you can, using the Noxious Scythe for the extended range. Stand in the area shown below, sip an aggression potion, pray and use AoEs such as Hurricane , Bladed Dive , Quake , Cleave , and Meteor Strike to deal large AoE damage. Remember to put dominion mines down every minute, and utilise Berserk and Zgs Spec to deal more damage. Use lossless healing food such as Saradomin Brews and Blue Blubber Jellyfish to keep hp up, alongside a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism . Due to a low hitchance without a stab weapon, an accuracy boosting aura such as / should be used. \u2b25 Melee is the best way to kill mammoths, however magic with the Inquisitor's staff can also be viable. The strategy is less aoe-focused with magic, and make sure to stay in melee distance to avoid the smite attack. Try to use your Sunshine in an area where many mammoths can be reached, as to avoid getting smited.

This is a powerful t85 crossbow, dropped at a rate of 1/2000 on-task and 1/10,000 off-task. Location and How to Get There Living \ud83d\ude2e Wyverns are \ud83d\udca6 located inside \ud83c\udfe0 the Asgarnian Ice Dungeon, accessed via a rope \u27b0 in \ud83c\udf4c the south of the \ud83d\udc10\ud83d\udc49 Skeletal Wyvern room. The easiest way to get \ud83c\ude50\ud83e\udd23 there \ud83d\ude0d would \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc4d be via \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 the Port Sarim lodestone and run \ud83c\udfc3 south \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 to \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\ude45 the \ud83d\udc66 dungeon entrance, then \u27a1 take \ud83d\udc68 the agility shortcut directly \u27a1\u27a1 east of \u2620 the \ud83d\udc4f\u2702 ladder. \ud83c\udfa2\ud83c\udfa2 Alternatively, the fairy ring \ud83d\udc8d A.I.Q \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc4c can be \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udca6 used to \ud83d\udca6\u270c get \ud83d\ude22 to \u27a1\ud83d\udc49 Mudskipper Point. \u2b06\u2b06 Useful Items \u2b25 To avoid the majority of the Wyvern's breath damage, a potion that blocks Wyrmbreath must be used, such as an overload salve variant or a Wyrmfire potion. \u2b25 Dominion Mines - used to deal 2 large hits every minute, significantly lowering the hp of one Wyvern. \u2b25 Bonecrusher - with the \ud83d\udeaa bonepicker upgrade from \ud83e\udd24\ud83d\udc49 the \ud83d\udc96 Arc, this \ud83d\ude9f\u261d is \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udd70 extremely useful for \ud83d\udcb0 picking up \ud83c\udffb\u261d Wyvern bones, \u26cf where \ud83d\ude20\u2642 they can \ud83d\udee2 be \ud83d\udc7c\ud83d\udc1d easily \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude03 noted whilst \ud83c\udfa9\ud83c\udfa9 continuing to kill \ud83d\udd2a Wyverns. \u2b25 Death \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\udc80 Note \ud83d\udcdd Relic - Automatically notes dropped bones and \ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude1f ashes. With \ud83d\ude0e the \ud83d\udc06 bonepicker upgrade, this \ud83c\udfc4 automatically picks up \ud83d\ude0d noted bones. \ud83c\udf46 Method \u2b25 The main mechanic to look out for when killing Wyverns is the frost % that builds up the more time you spend in the cave. Standing next to a lit fire reduces the frost quickly, but should only be done when required. The frost % has different effects depending on how cold the player is. When the player first enters, the Wyvern's poison damage will be large, hitting for up to 900 per hitsplat, however this is reduced to around 300 damage when the frost reaches 25%. After this, the Wyvern's auto-attack damage is increased up to 2500, and when the frost reaches 100% the player is frozen and stunned for 10 seconds. If this happens, the player should leave the cave, or use and immediately stand next to a fire. \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e\u2022 It \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\ude02 is optimal to keep frost above \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\udc46 25% \ud83d\udc4f and below \u2b07\u2b07 100, \ud83d\udcaf and \ud83d\udc40\u23f1 spend as little \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\udc67 time as \ud83c\udfff possible \ud83d\udd1d next \ud83c\udf28\ud83d\ude38 to a fire \u2b25 Living Wyverns can hit quite hard with their range and magic auto-attacks, but in melee distance deal less damage. Wyverns are stunnable, so they can be stunned repeatedly to avoid taking damage at all. is used to regain lifepoints, and the Wyverns are fought in single combat. \u2b25 Melee - Melee is good at Wyverns, as being melee distance reduces the damage taken, and due to their low hp they can be killed extremely quickly when under the effects of Berserk . Utilising movement abilities such as Bladed Dive and gBarge should be prioritised, to hop quickly between the Wyverns. In the middle of the room there is a Wyvern spawn that is next to a fire, aim to attack that spawn when the frost is getting close to 100%. Due to their spread spawns, usage of the Zgs Spec isn't recommended, however a TMW Spear can be utilised effectively to increase kph. Casting Slaughter and Dismember and moving on to another Wyvern is recommended if the hits are high, and if utilising gBarge , bled thresholds can be applied from a distance to high hp targets. \u2b25 Magic - Magic is the best style at wyverns, due to their weakness to the Inquisitor's staff . Stand close to a fire, and simply damage Wyverns within range. Wyverns are stunnable and bindable, so Ice Blitz + Wrack can be a powerful combo. Blood spells help with healing, alongside Vampyrism aura if required. The fire directly to the west of the rope has a spawn that Dominion Mines can be placed next to every minute for two 7k hits.

This can be useful to aid the player's survivability, but is by no means a requirement. Method Mechanics Ripper Demons have \ud83c\udfb2 a \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4c few \ud83d\ude0b mechanics: \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0 \u2b25 When engaged from a distance, immediately teleport to the player and cast Slaughter , which deals triple damage if the target moves. \u2b25 They \ud83d\udc68\u2728 also have a Special attack, \u2694\u2694 where adrenaline \ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89 is built \ud83d\udee0 via \ud83d\udcb0 auto-attacks \ud83e\udd16 and shown \ud83d\udeab on \ud83d\udd1b the \ud83c\udf70\u2640 bar \ud83d\ude2b above their \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udcb4 heads, when \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc49 this bar \ud83e\udd43\ud83d\ude2b fills they \ud83d\udc48 jump, \ud83d\udc4f and \ud83c\udf85 land where the player \ud83d\udc68\ud83e\udd3a is standing \ud83c\udfff\ud83c\udfff shortly after, dealing \ud83d\udeac up \u2b06 to 32000 damage \u2620\u2604 and \ud83d\udca6 usually resulting in \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f instant kill. This can be avoided by \ud83c\udffb moving away from \ud83c\udf46\u27a1 where \ud83d\ude3e you \ud83d\ude1b\u2764 were \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc76 standing \ud83d\udd2a immediately \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d upon seeing \ud83d\udc40 them jump. \ud83c\udffb \u2b25 If the player is below 35% HP, all nearby Ripper Demons will immediately aggro to the player.

The \ud83d\udc48 methods are \ud83d\udc87\ud83d\udc74 explained below. \u2b07\u2b07 Ranged Method \u2b25 Up to 1100 KPH \u2b25 Ripper Demons have a low affinity to ranged attacks, however due to Mechanised Chinchompas offering excellent AOE damage, Rippers can be done most effectively with ranged. This is done ideally with the usage of a melee combat training dummy, namely the ones only currently available off treasure hunter. Note: Ironmen can also attack treasure hunter dummies. \u2b25 To chin Ripper Demons effectively it requires good gear and good ability knowledge, alongside inventory management to increase profit with Binding Contracts. Starting with 100% adrenaline, stand in the most southern part of the first cave, as shown in the videos and image linked below. Pre-place the cannon to aggro the rippers in the room, start with Death's Swiftness and use dps rotations on the dummy. Place the cannon on the red square, stand on the yellow arrow and step into the yellow square, so that the dummy is placed on the blue square.

This will allow the next Death's Swiftness to have excess adrenaline, which can be used in conjunction with the Dark Bow special attack, stored in an Essence of Finality , which deals huge damage for 65% adrenaline.

Preset Range Cannon + Dummy Square Melee Semi-AOE \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 Method \u2b25 Up \u2764\ud83d\udd3a to \u2642 700 KPH \u2b25 This method involves the usage of the aggression ability and the Ricochet ability to allow for the semi-aoe aspect, where the player fights Rippers 1v1 in the small room until Devotion is off-cooldown, before aggro-ing multiple Rippers in the large room to AoE down whilst taking no damage. This method is extremely consistent and easy to do, whilst remaining low risk. \u2b25 The \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f rotation is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude02 as follows: \u2192 + Aggression ability \u2192 AoEs such as / / / \u2192 Fight 1v1 in the small room \u2192 C4 \u2192 \u2192 AoEs such as / / / \u2192 Repeat. \u2b25 Make sure to use Devotion after killing a target for it to be lossless. Laceration Boots are extremely powerful here, allowing the player to use Blade Dive with a Scythe , making for a large 5x5 AoE ability that resets cooldown upon the target dying, meaning it can be used often. \u2b25 Ricochet will always tag Rippers even though it will splash, and if the player does not own a ZGS , they can replace it with Annihilation EoF spec or Meteor Strike , however make sure to keep the Scythe on after using the Annihilation. To deal with Elite spawns, simply target them as the main focus, as Hurricane will hit them twice. Use the Demon Slayer ability during the non-zerk AoE. Preset Melee AOE Method \u2b25 Up \ud83d\udcb0\u2764 to 800 KPH \u2b25 Similar to the semi-AoE method, full AoE relies on constant AoE abilities through the usage of Bladed Dive with Laceration Boots , but this method uses an Oldak Coil and Aggression potions to constantly upkeep Ripper aggression. Due to their hard hitting attacks, this method relies on healing through a Pack Mammoth with lossless food such as Blue Blubber Jellyfish / Guthix Rests , alongside a Scrimshaw of Vampyrism . \u2b25 Stand to the east of the cave, place the Oldak Coil on the red square shown in the image below, and step back east to the yellow square to attack the demons. Use the Berserk ability when you have Devotion active, similar to the previous method, and in between use ZGS spec and Meteor Strike to keep damage high. If attacking multiple demons without a damage boosting effect, this is a good time to use your Demon Slayer ability to help keep damage high. If all the Rippers in the room are dead, step north to the other yellow square to escape the spin and reduce damage taken. Alloy Spikes are useful here to provide more hitsplats for poison damage. \u2b25 Usage of \ud83d\udc49 auto-retaliate \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udd16 can be \ud83d\udc1d useful for \ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udf85 situational 2h auto \ud83e\udd16 attacks.

This \ud83d\udc48\ud83d\ude1e can \ud83d\ude27 sometimes make \ud83d\udc86\ud83d\udd95 it \ud83d\udcaf difficult to \ud83d\udc6c target the \ud83d\udc68 correct \u2705 Ripper Demon \ud83d\udc7a through clicking, making auto-retaliate a \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udde3 reasonable option here. \ud83d\udc4c Target Cycling \ud83d\udeb4\ud83d\udeb4 can \ud83d\udee2 also \ud83d\ude47 be used, \ud83c\udd92 but \ud83d\ude1c will \u26bd lose \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\ude31 the easy \ud83d\ude45\u2757 access \ud83d\udd16\ud83d\udeaa to \ud83d\udc73\ud83d\udcb0 a \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc1d 2h auto attack. \ud83e\udd3c Preset Coil + Standing Areas Legacy Magic \ud83d\udcff Method \u2b25 Up \ud83d\udc40 to 700 KPH \u2b25 This method also uses the dummy method like the ranged setup, but uses legacy blood burst with an Inquisitor's Staff to damage the Rippers. This can achieve ~700 KPH which is very good for an AFK method, but does require upfront gear investment in the form of an Inquisitor's staff. The method is mostly reliable, however can be prone to getting hit by the Ripper's special attack, where the player would need to move. Due to the nature of Blood spells' secondary targets taking reduced damage, if the player is active they should target attacking rippers to ensure no special attacks. Place the cannon and dummy in the same spot as the ranged method. \u2b25 The usage of a Unicorn Stallion is recommended to provide extra healing if necessary, alongside Blue Blubber Jellyfish or healing potions such as Super Guthix Brews / Saradomin Brews , as they will not severely delay your attacks. \u2b25 This method can reach \u2640\ud83c\udffe higher \ud83d\udd1d XP/h than \ud83d\udc49 the melee method despite being \ud83d\ude11 lower \ud83e\udd13 kph, as a \ud83d\ude0e Scrimshaw of Sacrifice can \ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca6 be \u2744\ud83c\udd70 utilised effectively, as \ud83d\udcb0 it \ud83d\udd2b does \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude33 not affect Binding \ud83e\udd1d Contracts, maintaining a bulk of \ud83d\udca6 the \ud83d\udca6\ud83e\udd1c profit. \u274c \u2b25 Make sure \ud83d\udd1c\ud83d\udc4d auto-retaliate is \ud83c\ude36\ud83e\udd1a OFF. \ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udca6 A lot of actions \ud83e\udd3c will stop you \ud83d\ude44 from \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc49 automatically \ud83e\udd16 attacking the dummy in \ud83d\udd55 Legacy.
